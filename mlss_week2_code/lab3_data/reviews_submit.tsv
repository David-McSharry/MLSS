		A22RMVO4OIP86Z	Liver treats seem off...	I have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china I find disturbing.<br /><br />Regardless, the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd, plastic texture.<br /><br />The duck and chicken are both great--but I will be investigating the source of the food.	1	1
		AQE707L9GDYUF	Inconsistant freshness	We have been ordering this coffee for over a year and we like it better than any other coffees we have tried. Sometimes the beans are fresh and look oily. Other times they are dry and lack aroma. We were ordering direct from Coffee Bean Direct and got fresher coffee than the coffer we get from Amazon on the automatic ordering system to save money. I don't know if they warehouse the coffee longer than the Coffee Bean Direct or what. There is a difference. If the freshness does not improve soon We will go back to ordering from Coffee Bean Direct and paying more. When it is fresh it is a five-star coffee.	0	0
		A2YLKQJOGJ8R85	Grove Square Hot Cocoa	Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it.	0	0
		A84GFO7DMCO2U	Bad Smell + Bad Taste = AWFUL	I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but the positive reviews on this product made me hopeful. While mixing the ingredients, a foul smell filled the kitchen. When I poured the batter into the waffle iron, the smell improved slightly. Again... hopeful. Yet while the texture resembled a waffle, the taste was so bad I spit it out immediately. No syrup/whipped creme/fruit can cover up the taste. Skip the batter and try the Atkins Caramel Chocolate Nut Roll instead. Tastes just like a Baby Ruth :)	4	3
		A1E80QJ5PPLC7N	Excellant Product	I have never been able to get adult cats to take pills very easily until know.  This product makes taking pills a treat for cats.  It's just wonderful no more fighting to get my cat to take necessary medicine.	1	0
		A1JHW6YMGLJQLC	Almost too strong!	My biggest gripe with the Keurig pods is that the coffee is too weak so I always try the bold varieties.  I think I met my match with this one though. Its almost too strong for me.  I take my coffee black and this one has just a hint of bitterness. I have to use the tallest coffee cup setting when I use this pod.  Dont get me wrong...its a good cup of joe but for my taste I think I like the Emerill bold pods a tad better.<br /><br />On the plus side you can often reuse this pod for a second cup as its strong enough to still make a good cup second time around.	11	0
		A1D3FXS4MWT6JM	My cats LOVE this!	I have 7 cats, ranging in age from 15 years, down to 2 years & they ALL LOVE THIS!  I used to feed them another brand of food (they're all indoor cats) & when I introduced them to this food, they couldn't get enough of it!  They've been eating this food EXCLUSIVELY for at LEAST 7 years now (obviously, the younger ones have been eating it for less time) & NONE of them has EVER been sick from it!	1	0
		A29BXBSJW26CS2	Baking Soda	Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda is an excellent product for baking with or making your own toothpaste.<br />It is aluminum free and free of any other harmful chemicals. We use it as a safe/legal product<br />on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet in healing my boys with ASD and healing my own fibromyalgia<br />as we have difficulty ridding our body of harmful toxins in foods.	8	0
		A3UGMFQAD5IJN0	A perfect ghee!	This organic, grass-fed ghee embodies everything that a modern, healthful food should be. It is tasty, healthful, fresh, and lovingly produced by hand in small batches and according to ages-old methods and principles.<br /><br />I began using this ghee as a part of a transition to eating more healthy, home-cooked foods. More recently, I participated in an Ayurvedic cleanse that required that I take 1/4 cup of plain, warm ghee for several mornings straight! Though this can be an unpleasant experience with ghee of lower quality, the Pure Indian Foods ghee was truly delicious. The flavor is clean and sweet, without any of the harshness or overbearing unctuousness of other ghees (even those labelled as organic). And not a hint of rancidity, to which I'm very sensitive.<br /><br />Only unhomogenized milk is used for this ghee, which is unusual and extremely beneficial. Homogenization alters the structure of milkfats and adversely impacts their bioavailability and handling in the blood. This attention to the quality of raw materials is just one example of this company's dedication to their customers' health.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	12	0
		A3BLNKGV0FQG3K	Yummy, but expiring	We liked the product, my kids thought they were wonderful, but I was bummed to see that the sell by date on the cookies was less than 30 days from the date that I received them.  How can we eat 12 bags of cookies in that amount of time?  We won't and they will get stale.  I thought that was lousy.	13	2
		AMICVVFSEDRE	Best deal for prepackaged Stevia	I like the quality of the product over all that I have tried.  Nothing but good ingredients and not overly sweet..good balance.  I will definitely buy again.  Use it every day.	1	0
		A19S0T41IJIQI3	Tea?  What Tea?	Honestly, that's what I thought throughout trying this tea.  The smell and taste is entirely of cinnamon.  I couldn't ever taste the tea- and even in my smallest cup it tasted weak and watery.<br /><br />If you want caffeinated cinnamon, go for it.<br /><br />If you want true chai... look elsewhere.<br /><br />PS.  What's with the size of the bags?  Not even 2 grams per bag.  Even for American-style tea bags, this is small.	3	2
		A1ED3ABQD627TY	Disappointed in STASH PREMIEUM TEA	STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used.  The Decaf Chocolate Hazelnut Tea has absolutely NO flavor even when I try 3 tea bags to a cup of boiling water. I purchased 6 - 18 count boxes.  I had tried a hot chocolate tea in one of our little delis and it was wonderful.  I don't remember the name of the tea.  I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch.  I'm sitting here with over 100 tea bags with absolutely no flavor.<br /><br />If you're looking for a tea with flavor, I would discourage your using this tea.	0	0
		AGARST1GFFKFC	Didn't help with severe menstrual cramps	I took it for a few months and I didn't notice any difference. I drank 2-3 cups a day for at least a week before my periods but it still didn't help. I had severe menstrual cramps though. By severe I mean the kind that make you throw up before pain killers start working, feel like you're going to pass out, and writhe in such pain that you are unable to do even the simplest things. This tea probably won't help if you have it that bad.	1	0
		ARYFEV09RAOYM	Quick and Tasty! Best Noodles!	These noodles are very quick to make and quite tasty. It comes with dried vegetables and a spicy seasoning.  It can be made in less than 8 minutes on the stovetop. 3 minutes for water to boil and 5 minutes to cook.<br /><br />I am a fan of spicy foods but these noodles can be a little too spicy. I use about half the packet to cut back on the spiciness and sodium.<br /><br />If you need something quick, easy and tasty to make for a meal this is definitely it!	1	2
		A3G2CX49XSEE6B	Energizing	I had purchased this tea months ago at Whole Foods and was delighted to see that it is on Amazon. I don't know much about tea, and this is not the best I've ever tasted, but it is very energizing.	0	0
		A22QNCSBRC8Y9Y	Disappointing	"This purchase disappointed me for two reasons.<br /><br />First, I had never before tried the redskin version of Feridies Virginia peanuts, and I found them to be more like regular peanuts (like Planters) in both size and texture than the large, super-crunchy Virginia variety I was expecting.<br /><br />Second, the peanuts in the cans were a bit on the stale side.  Unfortunately, this is a frequent problem with nut cans that are sealed with those flimsy foil tops, but this was the first time I had encountered any degree of staleness with Feridies products.<br /><br />When I ordered these redskin peanuts, I also placed a separate order for the regular (non-redskin) Feridies Virginia peanuts, and they seemed perfectly fresh.  My guess is that the cans of redskins had been languishing on the shelf for a bit too long.  It would have been helpful to find some kind of ""sell by"" label on the cans, as the Virginia peanuts from Harry & David always have."	1	0
		A3BU6Q0EI9DJU1	Great On the Go Breakfast	I really enjoyed this cereal bar. The banana nut bread flavor tasted authentic and not at all like banana flavoring. It was moist and dense, an all around great bar.	0	0
		A1W4SKEQY8Q9K6	wrong quantity	The boxes contain 12 sausages each,not 24, which means I received half of what the description says. I was charged for 24 but only received 12. I contacted amazon and they say they will credit my acct. for the right amount.	1	0
		A2WRMO5KKZ5APC	Healthy, tasty tea. Good sweet or unsweetened, hot or cold.	"When we were kids, our mother always kept pitchers of barley tea in the fridge. Last year, I came across a box at an Asian grocery store and now can't imagine life without it. We live over 100 miles from the Asian store so are happy to have found it here on Amazon.com ... and hope they stop carrying it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Flavor - Don't use more water than instructed for each teabag. It's got a subtle, nutty flavor.<br />* Caffeine-free. One cup of tea or coffee can keep me awake all night, so this keeps me from wrecking my sleep schedule.<br />* Lots of health benefits (I won't go into it here, but you can Google for info.)<br />* Good hot or cold. In winter, we keep a pot on the stove and drink it all day. In summer, it's great refrigerated.<br />* Sweetened or unsweetened. You can make this tea appealing to kids by sweetening; we use a mixture of brown sugar and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00445K4JY"">Splenda No-Calorie Sweetener with Fiber</a>.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't think of any!<br /><br />We'll be needing to move up our next Subscribe & Save shipment!"	0	0
		A2VEWMANJF5XO8	Excellent tea	This is a very pleasant tea for anyone that enjoys a decaf tea. Nice to drink in the evening since it doesn't contain caffeine. It is a softer tea than Earl Grey and has a mild citrus flavor that is refreshing.	1	0
		A3PRVC4V2CZAPR	Tastes AMAZING, buuut...is it worth it?	"PROS: this product TASTES and FEELS like REAL peanut butter. I would pay double...if I could deal with the cons:<br /><br />CONS: Gas. Horrible, horrible gas. And not just me - everyone who I know who has tried it experienced mind-blowing flatulence within 36 hours. And not just ""bad"" gas - we're talking about the kind you wish you could summon when the cop leans into your window and says ""license and registration?""<br /><br />I wish I could continue to use this product...but I can't even stand MYSELF the next day, and seriously, that's bad: everyone usually loves their own brand!"	30	5
		A2LN5DDGT21310	THESE ARE VERY GOOD	These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier.	2	3
		A11QSEA6DZM4FZ	radtechmom	Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!	0	0

		AN31VL4F0KYQ5	AWESOME PRODUCT!	"I am a college student of health sciences and the mother to a 3 yr old toddler. I personally show very little response to ""placebo effect"" situations and I am a true skeptic at heart. I originally found the ""kid"" version of this product for my daughter while searching for something to boost her immune system. I spent hours on the computer researching the ingredients of these products. I decided to try the adult version for myself and I can honestly say that the Amazing Grass Superfood Powders have made a huge improvement in both of our lives.<br /><br /> My daughter attends daycare and with that setting comes frequent colds/flus, some serious. She spent the better part of each month with varying degrees of sickness. Since we have using the Superfood Powders (months), neither she nor I have gotten sick. We spent time with my parents who were both very ill while she and I remained in good health.<br /><br /> I have a greater amount of energy since using this product as well. I have chronic fatigue but the effects are greatly reduced since drinking this powder. It is also nice to know that my body is getting the nutrients it needs to perform well. It is difficult to include all the necessary foods in your diet that your body needs to thrive but the Amazing Grass products take care of that.<br /><br />Who cares whether or not it tastes ""just like chocolate milk""? It isnt meant to be sold as a dessert drink. It is meant to keep you healthy. I mix one scoop of powder with 8 oz of almond milk and add 1 tsp of Ovaltine. It tastes great. No, it doesnt taste just like chocolate milk but it is definitely palatable and does not need to be consumed ""fast"". Anyone who has tasted pure Spirulina powder can agree that this is MAJORLY masking the flavor of its healthy ingredients!!<br /><br />Overall, EXCELLENT product! I am getting ready to purchase my 4th jar!"	2	0
		A1MSA051FI91A5	YUM	Mixed nicely and quickly with immersion blender, smooth and tasty. I used almond milk instead of water. Even more delicious if you add i/2 frozen banana. Amazon's price now is better than my local HFS, too.	1	0
		AR33KU52LIBF1	Good coffee, but additives leave aftertaste	There is a nice strong coffee flavor and the right amount of sweetness to the drink but the additives leave an acidic aftertaste that is a little off-putting.  Maybe a little cream or vanilla flavoring could help?	0	0
		A1XSW5X7EWLD9R	Not bitter? Says you . . .	I've had my Keurig for about two years and love the Bold coffees.  As any Keurig owner will tell you, with the Keurig, you have to buy Bold to get a decent strength or flavor to your coffee.  I usually buy the Newman's Own Bold (unfortunately no longer available on Amazon) or other similar flavors like Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend.  Unfortunately, Green Mountain isn't yet available on the Subscribe & Save program.  I was very excited to try Emeril's after reading the glowing reviews, in particular because there were several mentioning how smooth and non-bitter it is.  Many of the Bold K-Cup flavors tend to be bitter.  My excitement lasted until my first taste where I discovered a bold coffee with sour and bitter undertones.  It's not so bad that I won't finish it but I will not buy it again.	0	0
		A2UGCA3LV9U449	As good as Starbucks!	This is the best Chai Tea Latte I have ever found.  I use skim milk instead of water, although water is fine, but I find that the skim milk give it the Starbucks taste.  I also use 2 cups of milk instead of the recommend 1 cup as it is to sweet for my taste with only 1 cup.  The tea latte taste is still there but I think it's the milk that makes it.  I would recommend this to anyone as I have not found any better	1	0
		A3K6I223PR0PMX	This is Halvah?	Been eating Halvah for 64 years now and this is the worst thing I have ever tasted that is called Halvah.  Dry, crumbly, falls apart and tastes like ground up cardboard.	2	0
		A2YX2F3H3689BM	Nothing Special	I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snow's, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money.	0	0
		A3TLHOKVUV1TU6	Hurricane Stock	Great shelf life and you can make it so many different ways. It is great to have when we know there is a storm on the way here in Florida.	12	0
		AUGU89R1XNKX9	Weak, as usual for this brand	I bought this recently, not paying attention to brand.  When I got it home, I realized it was Stash, and thought, oh, no, here comes the weak tea!<br /><br />Indeed, as with other of their teas, it is weak.  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea, and it was still pretty weak in flavor.  When I've made hot tea with it, I need two tea bags.<br /><br />The flavor is ok--I love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberry--but it's really just too weak overall.  Will not purchase again.	0	1
		A1QFM9CFEUXZK5	Tasty snack!	If you're like me, sometimes you might just crave the taste of chocolate, despite the fact that you really know you shouldn't eat any (assuming it's not on your eating plan)!<br /><br />Well, if that's the case, than these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds will alleviate those cravings while providing a healthy snack chock full of protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />I only ate 5 of these almonds and was completely satisfied. The cocoa has a subtle, yet tasty, chocolaty flavor and the almonds tasted fresh.<br /><br />My son, though, really enjoys these nuts and eats 'em by the handful.  This is a good product I'd completely recommend.	17	1
		A2Y0FKOY6WE0NQ	"Do they have to ""bite back""?"	I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.	0	0
		A3TR02DDNFLXUE	Disgusting taste!! But hilarious!	As the title says, these wasabi gumballs were reaaally gross tasting. I tried one and only got through 5 or 6 chews before I had to spit it out.<br /><br />I got them as a stocking stuffer for Xmas and it was fun receiving them and I was excited to try them as I like trying unusual foods, etc. It was also fun getting my fiance to try one, knowing how gross they were and knowing that he had an even lower tolerance for gross tastes, hahah. After that I threw the rest out because I knew no one would eat them.<br /><br />So I agree with the previous reviewers who say this is great for a gag gift, but bad if you are seriously looking to buy for gum to chew.	1	0
		AMZCZBK1EF1PV	Ok, not the best	"I bought both this tuna, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB8AZC"">Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Skipjack Light Tuna, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> at the local grocery. Normally, I like a olive-oil pack tuna, like Cento, but I want to eat less Mercury, also be less disruptive to ocean ecosystems. Waters off the NW U.S. tend to be lower mercury than other oceans. The American tuna claims to be pole caught, which *is* sustainable. But skipjack is a faster growing fish, and the current population is sustainable.<br /><br />Regarding taste, the American Tuna was a dense and slightly dry hunk of fish surrounded by some fish juice and oil. The consistency was a little like canned salmon. It tasted ok from the can, but once mixed into a salad with chickpeas, it was a little too catfood-like.<br /><br />If you are in the market for sustainable + lower mercury tuna, I think the Wild Planet Skipjack tastes better."	5	2
		A3TNR75V00OM40	Gas	We had given our dogs (two beagles) beneful for a while.  They had *constant* gas.  We wrote it off as just normal.<br /><br />Well, we had to switch dog food brands for health reasons, and the gas stopped IMMEDIATELY!!  Do not give your dogs this dry dog food unless you own and want to constantly wear a gas mask!	4	1
		A3MGKO0T3DV8IV	"Not ""everlasting"""	I picked up several bento balls and large treat balls with these treats. I have a: one year old half Timber Wolf, half German Shepherd; seven year old retired bomb detection German Shepherd, 11 month old Lab/terrier mix, and 8 month old Smooth Collie. The treats were out of the balls within minutes and demolished in under 30 minutes. I had put several smaller treats into the ball as well, so after they finished the larger treats, they managed to be entertained by trying to get the small treats out. There hasn't been much that the pack hasn't been able to figure out.<br /><br />We regularly give them fresh deer bones as treats. The wolf will strip the meat while the shepherd will eat the bones, so I didn't expect these treats to be a true challenge for their jaw pressure and mental abilities. I will continue to get them and try other various tricks out. Some include putting the disc in upside down and adding peanut butter or other purees into the balls. The treats may not last long, but the balls will allow for some creative training.	2	0
		A12LMMWSZTNLZV	Not much taste but LOADS of salt	"I love peanuts and I also love salt but these nuts have very little taste EXCEPT salt.  Believe me, there is not much that I consider ""too salty"" but these certainly qualify.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, they are bland - not peanut-y.  Trader Joe's ""blister peanuts"" are far superior to these. Indeed, I think a commercial brand like Planters is probably superior (and much cheaper).  After this purchase, I am still on the lookout for peanuts better than I can purchase in the grocery store.<br />Sorry I got them."	1	2
		A1NX49A26OI9V0	Good Product - Bad Price	You get a small amount of candy for a large price. Look elsewhere this product is cheaper through other sources.	2	1
		A3KXLJJPWF3JX3	It's an okay nostalgic candy	The world's bubble gum cigarettes were frowned upon, but later enjoyed by my family. They were kind of hard at first, but quickly became softer.<br />The bubble gum however was a little flavorless and had a nasty flavor at the end...	1	0
		A2C64W88KUQKYO	Teenie Greenies	"My little dogs really like these ""teenie"" Greenies dental chewies. Not only are they good for the dogs' teeth, the dogs consider them a treat! I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are ""petites"" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again!"	1	0
		A2PL4KZQJ0VFOB	Over all, fairly good	I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better.	2	0
		A1U1RG7A8XAFGM	Great granola! Incorrection nutrition information on Amazon	This is a great gluten-free granola. I enjoy it with yogurt and fruit and with soy milk and fruit. I am excited to try making a gluten-free fruit crisp with it. I was dissapointed that the nutrition information on Amazon's site was inaccurate. There is less fiber and more sugar in the product than listed. However, I will still continue to purchase this delicious granola. My husband and son who don't have to follow a restrictive diet also enjoy it.	0	0
		A360EFJOE4L7IZ	Fine Food for Diverse Cats	I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.  The other is too large and needs to loose weight.<br /><br />The smaller cat likes this food. The overweight cat does not over eat on the food, which is a plus for us.<br /><br />We tried Wellness, C&P Organix, Innova Evo (they loved the dry food), Pet Promise, the Whole Foods brand and a few others.  Our cats did not like those brands of food.  Some they wouldn't even eat.<br /><br />They prefer the chicken and salmon brand to the other Newman's Own canned cat food flavors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Organic<br />* Peace of mind for the cat owner<br />* Liked by cats with 'special needs'<br />* Preferred over other brands by two very different cats<br />* When I open some canned cat foods, the smell nauseates me. The smell of this brand doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I can think of<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a good organic canned cat food.  Cats differ in their food preferences.  It's a good idea to give this one a try.  By the way, for a while, one or more of the flavors were only available in the smaller cans.  If that is still the case, you may want to try those flavors as well.	8	0
		A1BEMKOWN1TJK4	Made in China	I wish I had known these were made in China, I never would have bought them. There is currently an epidemic of illness and death related to pet foods manufactured in China, including products by this manufacturere (Cadet). These are going in the garbage.	5	0
		A262SWHVXZUZZD	Very average at best	This tea is slightly better than the supermarket brands because it is a roasted green tea. Otherwise, it's very average tasting. I would not buy again.	0	0
		A1Q3C8EFFVBWU	Revised review	My original review was full of praise of this formula, it's still down below this one. However, I have to give the company and their formula 1 star after the events of the past week. On Feb 16th their two main formula brands, dairy and soy, both tested very high for arsenic (organic and inorganic versions). The company promised to conduct their own testing and come back with their findings. Today they got their results back from their third party laboratory, but refuse to share the findings from said laboratory. They claim that their formula upholds to the FDA regulations, but since there are no FDA regulations for arsenic in food, that really doesn't hold any merit. I really wished and hoped that the company would come back and discredit the arsenic-study, however, this in my eyes just proved that the study was correct. I am currently on the lookout for another brand of formula for my baby.<br /><br />This is my original review:<br /><br />Our daughter has been really fussy and slept really poorly when we fed her a major brand formula. We tried said major brands formula for gassy and fussiness, but she refused to drink it. Then we got this formula at a national chain healthy food store. She loves the stuff. It smells and tastes much nicer than other formulas (yes, I have tasted formula) and resembled my breastmilk better than other formulas. I wish we had known about this formula when I needed to supplement her, because she would refuse to drink other formula if she was receiving breastmilk and I think she would gladly have drank this one.<br /><br />Anyway, after 4 days on this formula, she would sleep through the night and not wake up grumping and groaning at night. We couldn't afford more cans right now, so we went back to the major brand formula yesterday, and last night she woke up 5-6 times complaining as well as waking up for a night time feed.	1	1
		A3J4NARZK4Q4PX	Suprisingly yummy...great texture!	My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other brands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! These are yummy! Great texture & flavor. Great ingredients too! We will be stocking up on these as a healthy, convenient protein packed snack.	7	1
		A1Z6CKPOBXUZ49	"now made from Concentrate, ""natural flavor"" added..yuk!"	"Coca Cola now partially owns Zico. So, now it's made from concentrate, has added ""natural flavors"" and is packaged in plastic. How to ruin nature's perfect drink for profit. This was my favorite, now I will not buy this ""new formula"" again...Looking to find another like Zico used to be. Don't know yet if the Zico tetra pak is still the ""old formula""..also..rumor has it that Pepsi is looking to buy Vita Coco..so will be keeping my eye on this, too"	8	4
		A36SXS4ME0K854	Protein content too high... gave my dog acute renal failure.  RIP Ollie	About 3 months ago I researched all the different foods and finally decided to purchase EVO because I thought it was what was best for my dog.  He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.  If it goes on much longer without improving I will face the horrible decision of humane euthanization.  I feel that it was caused 100% from the high protein diet.  We can find NO other cause and he has no underlying kidney disease.  Please choose a different food and save the pain that my dog and I are going through right now.<br />UPDATE>>> Not long after I made this review Ollie lost his battle to acute renal failure at the young age of 3.  No other underlying condition was found and my vet feels that the extremely high protein content in EVO is what shut his kidneys down.  RIP Ollie... :-(	3	0
		AB9NYVKQO5C4Q	Not My Cup of Tea	"I didn't like this tea at all.  I prepared it according to package directions but it was very, very green and kind of thick.  I didn't like the taste but I will admit I didn't drink much of it.  I think I'll stick to the regular white, green and oolong tea.  I thought of making the tea ""weaker"" but didn't....I don't think I would have liked it any better :)"	2	16
		A2SPS4EMAMWQDI	Rhubarb Spread	I should have read the label on this: It is a spread, not jam. The flavor is acceptable, but I've been looking for a good rhubarb (not rhubarb-strawberry) jam since Bonne Maman stopped making theirs several years ago. I'm not rating my disappointment, though--even as a spread I thought this was average. I've also tried Andresy's rose jan (3 stars) and fig jam (4 stars).	0	0

		A36WGHR8TO5DKT	Agree; Best Chips I've Ever Had; Uber High in Vitamin C	I am an instant convert.  I would never purchase any other chips but these.<br /><br />The 12-pack of 5-oz bags shipped in a carton-inside-a-carton, arriving in great condition.  The chip bags are a sturdy plastic, and all chips appear to be in good condition.  Notably, these appear to have hardly any broken chips.<br /><br />A 1-oz. serving has only 140 calories, and 40% of your daily Vitamin C!  If eating only 1/5 of a bag of chips sounds unlikely to you, it's possible you could do it with these, since they are rich and leave you feeling sated.  I think that is because these are real food, rather than junk food.<br /><br />The individual chips roughly average 2 inches in diameter, some of them being folded in various shapes, and some flat.  The chip size is much more consistent than you usually see.  It's hard to tell, but I think these are unpeeled potatoes, of the variety that has a light-toned skin.  They are definitely thin chips, but I would say they are slightly thicker than Lay's potato chips.  The sea salt is used in balanced proportion, and adds nice flavor.  The avocado oil lends a very tasty, extremely subtle flavor that hints of citrus and fruitiness.  However, don't get me wrong - these don't taste fruity or sweet; they taste like regular potato chips.  They just have what I'd describe as a more sophisticated complexity in their simplicity.	2	0
		A3D0G7ZGY2LCOG	Special K Granola Bars - Good for a quick snack	These bars are cereal with dark chocolate and contain 110 calories with 4 gram of fiber and 4 grams of protein.  They aren't especially tasty, but would be good to have on hand for a quick low calorie snack.  They do contain peanut ingredients and may contain tree nuts which may effect people with allergies.	0	0
		A1OMXVXXP07F05	All that sugar and no real boost for me.	Not sure why I didn't get any real boost from this.  To me, it really isn't anything more than glorified Mountain Dew.  With 33g of sugar per serving (2 servings per can) and 130 calories each, it should at least give you enough energy to offset the calorie and sugar intake it provides.	1	0
		A3VOQNDCES5053	Some flavors are better than others	I bought YummyEarth Organic Lollipops to have to have in my office as an alternative to regular candy. First, the mini candy jar containers are handy and cute for display. Then there are the lollipops that look great and the flavors sound delicious. However, I didn't care for any of the flavors accept for the pomegranate (dark red). The pomegranate flavor was very good and exotic. The others were not very good. They tasted bitter. Long story short, no one in the office liked them either...and we have some hard-core sugar junkies that passed on them. If they sold a bag of pomegranate only, I might buy them again.	1	0

		A4TGFU3KSNSN1	If you like the smell of feet and the taste of chalk, this bar's for you	"I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, ""oooh I have to try"".  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies."	3	3

		A1K769403XG1EV	Tasty Oats	I found it difficult to get the Quaker Oats old-fashioned oatmeal on Amazon without having to pay shipping charges, so I tried these.  (I absolutely do not like the one-minute oats.  They are merely flakes of oats and not oats--but that's just my personal choice.)  The Country Choice Organic Oats are delicious, at least as good as the competition, and I like buying organic products.  Most importantly, the children like them and could tell no difference between these oats and the Quaker Oats they normally eat.  When we're finished eating this batch of oats, I will order another.	0	0

		AOP4KC76I40EE	Horrible.  The worst k-cup I've had by far.	"I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the ""real"" k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"".  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however."	1	0

		A30IP3E4MDQ36	Great training aid or as a reward.	- UPDATE - 10/28/2011<br />It's been several weeks of using it and there is still a ton of licking left, definitely getting my moneys worth out of this treat.<br />Another thing that has been nice is the ability to keep this in my pocket without making a mess. So going for a walk with it has been nice (and a great way to keep his attention when there are other not well behaved dogs around).<br />- UPDATE -<br /><br />Well the puppy dog has spoken... he loves Lickety Stik!<br /><br />When we first presented it to him he was a bit unsure and tried to bite the stick which was kind of cute but he quickly realized he had to lick it.<br />Now every time the Lickety Stik comes out as a reward or to teach him something, he just can't wait to lick the bejesus out of it.<br /><br />Not only does the dog love it and responds really well to it, it's made in the USA!<br /><br />This is a very unique, clean, easy to use, easy to carry, and fun treat for your dog. I would highly recommend this to most anyone. Way to go PetSafe!	7	0

		A1051DBTLWP5A2	Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!	"Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked ""interesting.""  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)"	0	0
		A2L4CXG23Z4U3U	Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!	The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.	0	0

		A1I6U5AQAT3ZG9	in 4 weeks my stylist noticed the difference in health	I am 50 year old and still have the same thick curly hair I did when I was 13.  I have been looking for the right mix of care products. Just last month I switched to three products:<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner,<br /><br />CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil,<br /><br />My hair is dryer now that I am older and the shampoo really does the trick of cleaning without destroying my hair, it cleanses completely to remove product build-up. The conditioner allows me to much more easily run a brush through my hair. Without flattening my hair it reduces the dryness that flat ironing can do and reduces breakage.  It really does lock in moisture and provide long lasting nourishment.  The Therapy works best on wet hair, it gives deep, non-greasy nourishment to my hair and lends a healthy looking shine.  I can wash, condition and therapy my hair Monday. Tuesday I can wet my hair put the therapy in and it looks brand new.<br /><br />The real test was going to my salon and my stylist of 8 years noticed the difference in softness. I love the blend of shea, vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm. It really works for me. I did find the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair.<br /><br />KEEPER!	1	0
		ASDCYQT0UQ1ZF	Best Baby Food, but not our favorite variety	Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Pears and Mangos<br />So, I remember feeding this to my son and it taking some time to warm up to this flavor. Eventually he did like it, but it still was never his favorite. Now, my daughter has started trying new flavors and with a day of trying this broke out in a terrible rash and was sick to her stomach. Prior to this she had eaten Pears by themselves without any problems and so my conclusion is that she is allergic to Mangos. So, for the time being we are staying away from products with mangos in them, but may try this again in the future once she has had more exposure to other items.	1	1
		A3HMCA3A1WG0Y1	Messed up my senseo	I have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency.  I have wasted two very expensive pods so far.  The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo.  The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far.  I am now afraid to try again.	5	1
		AFZUQHVCHUOCG	Beware - Kellogg's has reformulated this	"At the suggestion of my doctor, I have been eating Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus cereal for breakfast every day for several years now. A few days ago I opened a new box and discovered they have made changes in this product.  What a shock. I absolutely hate the new product.  I do not like the taste, I do not like the color, I do not like the slimy texture in milk. I loved the old Special K Protein Plus. I liked the taste.  I Liked the color.  I liked the texture.  I looked forward to it every day.  It was a great way to begin my day.  Now I am in misery.  It's as if my best friend is no longer here.<br /><br />And I looked at the nutrition information and see that they have reduced the fiber from 5 grams to 3 grams per serving, a reduction of 40 percent.  And they increased the sugar from 2 grams to 7 grams per serving, an increase in dangerous empty calories by 250%. I do not need more sugar in my life.<br /><br />And the front of the box states ""satisfies hunger longer--see side panel for details. I looked at the side panel and it says ""Special K Protein products are designed to promote a reduced feeling of hunger by increasing daily intake of protein and fiber"".  So they added this statement to the new box while at the same time they reduced fiber by 40%.  And they also reduced the amount of protein in the box by about 10% because they changed the serving size.  The old box had 13.2 servings and the new box only 11.96 servings.  Fool me once.  Shame on you. Fool me twice.  Shame on me.  I will not be eating Kellogg's products anymore."	5	0

		AL7R5LO0AUGKQ	Very pleased	This food is a hit!<br /><br />The cat likes it because it's got chunks of shredded meat in gravy.  He won't eat ground or pate-style foods, so the shredded meat in this one is a winner.<br /><br />I like it because, for one thing, it's grain-free.  To my mind, if you could only pick one quality to shop for, grain-free would be it; carbohydrates - and particularly grains! - are not good for cats.  It's very high in protein, which *is* good for cats.  It contains pumpkin, and while that is a carbohydrate, it's supposed to be good for their tummies.  I'm also pleased that it contains duck meat, since I like to rotate my cat's protein sources to take advantage of their differing nutritional profiles.  And finally, it's got plenty of gravy to help my cat stay hydrated; cats are built to take in much of their fluid from their food sources, so feeding dry food exclusively can dehydrate them (and possibly lead to urinary crystals).<br /><br />True, it's expensive.  Even for higher-end cat foods, it's expensive.  But if you'd ever had a cat develop diabetes because of an improper diet (i.e. dry foods high in carbs and too low in animal-based proteins) - or any other condition brought on by a poor diet - you'd agree that a little expense up front is way cheaper in the long run than treating the health condition.  The fact that I'm still giving it five stars should tell you something.  Not that I don't recommend shopping around for deals!)<br /><br />Give this food a shot.  It's a very healthful choice.	0	0
		A1WX80FIEONFPF	Great steaks -- Horrible delivery	I ordered 12 steaks but only six arrived.  I contacted Omaha and they said they would send six more.  When the six more arrived they were completely thawed and now I am afraid to eat them  -- maybe I will fry them up and give them to my dog -- he has a strong stomach.  The six that arrived on time and still frozen were delicious. If this were baseball I would be thrilled, but I am not happy batting .500 in the steak department.<br /><br />Update:  Omaha sent me 12 more steaks.  They arrived still frozen and the two I have eaten were delicious.<br /><br />So all told, I originally ordered 12 -- only six arrived -- six more were sent but were thawed -- but then they sent 12 and they were great.  So in the end I ordered 12, but got 18 great steaks.  Omaha made it more than right.  Omaha may not be good at counting but they get an A for effort.	0	0

		A1WOMXOEX90ARI	Good, But Not 5-Star...	"We like all kinds of rice, especially brown and basmati.  This rice is very good, but not 5-star.  It arrived quickly and in very good condition, mostly due to the excellent packaging.  It is the amongst the FRESHEST rice we've ever purchased (and we've purchased from the source).  It has a wonderful taste and aroma.  After cooking several batches, both on the stove and in our Zoji Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker, we like it, but find the texture to be just okay.  We've had better textured varieties in the past.  The grains are on the short side for ""long grain"" and they explode a little too much, even when we used less water.  It is very good, for brown rice; just not quite as good, for brown basmati.  We would buy it again, but not as our only source of brown basmati."	8	1

What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled ""Savory Chicken Flavor"". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it ""Savory"" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me."	3	7

He begged to buy a box from my secret stash as even in Seattle I can't seem to find a store that stocks them as regular merchandise. They are perfect to pack for a day trip, a late night snack, or any other time something crunchy seems appropriate. Yummmm!	1	0

		A121RZKYAZV6V	Good food for English bulldog	We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.	5	2
		A1KTNCAPHBDJYQ	Wellness is top dog	My Heidi is a Bichon with allergies and her doctor told me to keep her on Duck and Potato food as these were the least likely to cause an allergic reaction.  I, of course, wanted the best for my Heidi and Wellness is the best.	0	0
		ADWSD45P3NZGU	Does not taste like bacon	Received USPS, packaged well. Took a while to get here. So long, I forgot I had ordered it.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is that there is no 'sprinkling spout' in the top. There is a screw top cap then the top of the bottle is open. The opening is fairly large so you must be careful pouring it.<br /><br />Taste. It does not taste like bacon. It is not very hot. I can eat it from a spoon without having to drink anything afterwards. It taste like liquid smoke with spices added. It is ok but not something I really like. It is ok on a fried egg sandwich. It is ok used to cook popcorn.<br /><br />I will finish the bottle but I doubt I will reorder it. If I change my mind, which I sometimes do with food, I will update.	1	0
		A2K7ZSSBUHAQ5O	small tube filled with freeze-dried ice cream balls	There really isn't much to say about this.  If you like freeze-dried ice cream, you'll probably like this.  Like all freeze-dried ice cream, it seems ridiculously overpriced for what you get, but that's the way it goes.  About a quarter of the tube is filled with smooshed crumbs, but it eats the same.  The tube is small, of course - about 1.5 times the height of a chapstick and maybe twice the diameter.  It has white, brown, and pink balls (white seems to be the largest).  I listed them by color because I can't really say that they taste like vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry because they are so small.  All in all, I think I prefer the small bricks better than these little balls, but I kind of enjoyed flipping the top and pouring some into my mouth.	0	0
		A1BV6NR2FA0X3Y	Started out OK, now terrible two years later	My Amazon instant update says I bought these 2.5 years ago, so it's time for a recap review. I initially thought these had decent brightness, understandably somewhat dimmed compared to other similar 23-watt bulbs because of the full spectrum coatings. Now, however, they have reduced in brightness well beyond their initial levels and 1 of the 6 bulbs failed completely. For the price, this is a significant investment of money and I expected them to last much longer, especially since they are only used 20 or so hours per week. Essentially I'm at an estimated 2k or 3k (max) hours of use and I think it's time to replace them because we have 4 bulbs (2 each in 2 overhead fixtures) in one 13' x 16' room and it's hard to see at night because these bulbs have lost so much luminance. So the 8,000 hour lifespan is fairly misleading if my 6 bulbs are typical of the quality you can expect.	1	0

		A2F5AHGE7T0DIW	Poor customer service	I tried this food because reviews claim it is more natural and therefore more healthy for your dog, it also gives a satisfaction guarantee.  Well, the food made my dog sick! So I clipped the proof of purchase and mailed in my receipt as the guarantee asked. I got a coupon in the mail for a small bag of food! For one, the coupon is for a smaller bag of food. Two, I requested a refund....why would I give the same food to my dog and make him sick? I called customer service and they said you can only get refunds from the retailer! Ok, now that you took my reciept how do I do that? The customer service for Evo was unhelpful and was not able to help my situation. Apparently it is not a true satisfaction guarantee.	0	2
		A1CDKODRU6CHLU	Very misleading!!!!	The Jack Link's 30 Jerky Strips were verrrryyyy SKINNY! Some were only about 1/8 inch wide and counted as one strip. If I had known this, I would NOT have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty, but totally not worth the money!!!!	0	1

		A261E9A8AGO4JK	Yummy!	These cookies are fantastic! They're not too sweet, and not loaded with chocolate like other products.

		AT9ZES76SFEB3	It is not gluten free	-Update 7/7/12<br />While Betty Crocker now has many tasty gluten free products available, it appears the Asian fried rice beef and chicken helper products are no longer gluten free.-<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the Amazon page for this product, Asian Helper Chicken Fried Rice, do list wheat as an ingredient, as one rater has already noted.

		A320GBNO4D3QYQ	Way Better 'n Peanutbutter	I recently went on Weight Watchers and was missing peanut butter.  Then I picked some of this stuff up (at Trader Joe's) and was changed for life.  Its consistency is so good--creamier than peanut butter.  My friend with me said it tasted like the peanut butter in a Reese's.  I would never guess that one Tbsp is just one Weight Watcher's point.  It's sweet and creamy and hits the spot on a sandwich, apple slices, celery sticks, or my favorite:  a spoon.	1	0
		A3CFN1DW7YHUDP	I'm a fan...	Dude, these things are pretty good... as long as you're not bent on them being just like Oreos. I mean, they're not. But I definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams. The lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies, like peanut butter, cream cheese, icing, pudding, melted chocolate...	0	0
		A3TLJWAV1WNI7V	Great tasting brownies	I can make some really good brownies from scratch but if you want to save time, you can't find better brownies in a box than this. Chewy, rich and moist with a crunchy crust - people who don't have to eat gluten free keep asking for them.	0	0
		A2MWBSYJR74S75	Wonderful on it's own or mixed in drinks	This is the finest Cola I have found yet.<br /><br />There is a small store near me who sells it by the bottle.<br /><br />For cola drinkers, this is significantly better than Coke, Pepsi, etc., but the real treat is when you use this in place of Coke in drinks. (for those of you of legal drinking age)<br /><br />It's not just the quality of the liquor that makes a good rum & cola, Captain & cola, bourbon & cola, etc., it's the quality of the COLA that makes a good drink SOOO much better.<br /><br />Fore those of you mixing, use a high quality liquot with this high quality cola.<br /><br />I recommend Captain Morgan Reserve, Myers Dark Rum, Jim Beam Black, Maker's Mark, etc.	12	0
		A2FOV3T02SWT80	Nutella -Happiness in a plastic jar.

		A3C6M1APVEHL7Y	It's good, but not exceptional	"Honestly, it's not bad at all, but most commercial peanut butter does have some sweetner in it and if you are going from some of those types to this peanut butter, your first impression may be that it doesn't have the taste that you are expecting because the sugar isn't in there.  If you want the sweeter taste, btw, you can put a stevia in the peanut butter and mix it in.  That sounds messy but you can simply do it a bit at a time to the top layer of the jar.<br /><br />I also do not like the fact that it does have hydrogenated oil in it, which means trans fats.  But again this is something else most commercial peanut butters have.  They can get away with saying ""0"" trans fats on the label I'm assuming, because it's under 1/2 gram per serving.  Trans fats can occur naturally, however, and if you don't eat the peanut butter hand over fist, you really aren't consuming very much of it.<br /><br />I REALLY like the idea of their company to give 50% of profits to diabetes.  I like to support a company that is socially responsible.  All in all I'd buy it again."	0	0

		A2L7E6CTRT6OA	Great, if you like CARDBOARD	Okay, so the box sat on my counter for 2 months while I tried to find the time to make this product-- since it's not a quick thing to make pastries from scratch. I was going to feature this product on my blog--where I often give tips on healthy desserts, pet help & relationships. It's the holidays and I finally decided to make the time.  I got out my camera to chronicle this event and gave this my best efforts. Unfortunately, I just wasted 3 hours and lots of efforts on what turned out to be CARDBOARD.<br /><br />First, the company is in Australia, I believe, and assumes that we already know what to do. The directions were minimal and it didn't even give baking instructions--once the pastry was prepared.  It was very difficult and time consuming and the end result was YUCK.  There were many naughty words heard from the direction of the kitchen--and more accurately, my lips.  My husband and handyman were laughing-- right along with me--as I forced them to try them out.  Big thumbs down.<br /><br />* I'm sure a PASTRY CHEF or someone who does this all of the time--might have tips--but for the above average--gluten free baker--I would say, SKIP IT and find something else. I have made a LOT of gluten free products & even developed some recipes on my own--- but never had these kind of issues.<br /><br />I called Amazon and got a refund, they were wonderful and understanding and refunded my purchase. Hope this helps--Happy Healthier Baking!  :-)	2	1

At first use, however, it's immediately clear that they don't work as well as the original ones; they don't quite fit into the machine properly, the stream of coffee isn't as robust coming into the cup, and most importantly, the taste isn't the same.<br /><br />So, yes, they are priced less than the originals however I wouldn't purchase them again.<br /><br />Thanks!	1	0

		A23QXKCHT8KR05	Do Not Hesitate to buy Carbquik	"Attention Low Carbers and Diabetics!!!<br /><br />Yeah, I know.  You've tried other Low Carb products and most SUCK right?  I've been doing this for 12 years -- I lost 160 pounds the first 2 years and then slowly slipped and gained back about 50 pounds over the last 8 years. Believe me, it doesn't take much to put it back on.  I never went back to eating full blown carbs -- just more desserts, maybe a hamburger and fries here and there.  I am now back to strict low carb and the first thing I did was buy my wonderful Carbquik!!  Everything positive everyone said on these Amazon reviews is TRUE!!  I swear!  And the few negatives have got to be from people who are not EXCLUSIVELY low carb.  Is it expensive?  Not when you can finally have delicious biscuits or pancakes and a ton of other previously forbidden foods.<br /><br />I've tried every low carb packaged food around.  It's actually a lot of fun experimenting but I remember some DOOSIES!!  I remember the Atkins Macaroni and Cheese product (10 or 12 years ago)  OH MY GOD!!  Soooooo GROSS.  I literally gagged and choked from just a taste.  That was the worst product I've tried and the rest of just not very good.  CARBQUIK IS AWESOME.  Buy it right now!!  Netrition has it for 11.99 plus 5.95 shipping so it is a much better deal.  Which is unusual for Amazon -- they are usually the cheapest place.  I adore Amazon by the way!!!<br /><br />If anyone out there reading this is hesitant to try low carb, please do yourself a favor and read Gary Taubes ""Why We Get Fat and What To Do About It"".

		AOV20J7JOVXQE	Yeah, no.	I was trying to replicate a packaged salad I get that has a sweet onion honey mustard dressing that is supremely tasty.<br /><br />Paula Deen's variety however...<br /><br />Let's just say that if you projectile vomited, then replaced the bile with copious amounts of artificial sweetener, it would probably taste like this dressing, only slightly better.<br /><br />Tossed after 1 use.

		A1ZENB34HH2EIM	Yum.	These tea mixes are fantastic for work since they dissolve quickly and require no stirring IF you add them to your glass first.  Stirring or shaking is definitely ideal, but the beverage works without them.  Not too sweet and no bitterness that green tea mixes can sometimes have.  I didn't find that there was a pronounced tea flavor here, but enjoyed the light sweetness this mix added to a glass of cold water.  Oh, and I'd highly recommend adding ice AFTER mixing since ice seems to keep the powder from dissolving.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice and relatively low-calorie way to dress up water without a lot of artificial sweeteners.	0	2

		A3RFEZ1LQ3OZR0	Very tasty and affordable	"I use mate with black tea to get an extra dose of caffeine in the morning. That way my brew is not bitter and it packs a punch. This mate is the best I have had. It is fresh smelling and tasting, and it has a lot of flavor in the cup. Most mates are more in the background of the black tea in my concoction. This mate is front and center. I really enjoy it.<br /><br />On top of all that, it is not expensive. In fact, for its quality it is quite a bargain. I hope I can continue to get this product at this price.<br /><br />I have a gourd and I have used it once or twice.<br /><br />My preferred method is to use three cups of water to two teaspoons of tea and two of mate. I cool the water for 60 to 70 seconds before pouring it over the mixed tea and mate. I'm not a purist, but I get something I like and can drink on a consistent basis. It makes a good amount of liquor and it is mild to the palate and gives a good dose of caffeine.<br /><br />For tea, I use PG Tips Loose Tea.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JJQ"">PG Tips Black Tea, Loose Tea, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"	3	0

Normally I have much better manners than to finish off an entire can of snacks offered to me at someone's home, but these cashews were fantastic. They are large, creamy and buttery cashews sprinkled (okay showered) in a luscious coating of high quality sea salt and pepper. Definitely not a treat for ""blander"" palettes (unless you shake off the excess)...but for someone like me for whom there can never be too much pepper, these nuts are the holy grail of snacks. The excess coating is great to season seafood and makes a terrific cashew encrusted Tilapia...just yummy."	0	0

In fact, the first can I opened smelled so bad that I thought the product was spoiled and opened a second.  Now, either both were spoiled or neither were and it just smells horrific.

		ADY836HK6QSYR	Nice for a Starbucks item	This is a bit stronger than other vanilla coffees that I enjoy such as New England.  Depending upon your taste, you can enjoy a stronger brew or reduce the amount of coffee you use. I simply use a bit less coffee.  I was skeptical about this coffee as I find Starbucks coffee at the local stores has a burnt taste to it lately and I avoid their coffee in general.  This is a nice rich coffee and there is no hint of burnt coffee flavor.	0	0

		A2HVMLCH7XB2UC	Not rice....	I'm British, and this is one of the most popular candy bars in the UK (along with Cadbury's Flake).  This bar does not contain either rice or 'popping candy' as stated in the description.  Crunchie bars are old-fashioned 'honeycomb toffee' otherwise known as 'cinder toffee' covered in creamy milk chocolate.  Honeycomb toffee is basically a regular toffee to which a very small amount of vinegar and bicarbonate of soda is added, causing the toffee to puff up into an airy, crunchy, light toffee full of tiny holes.  The tiny amount of vinegar and bicarbonate of soda added does not adversely affect the toffee taste.	4	0
		A1NPKGCVWMMXGU	Not as advertised! Extremely Disappointed!	"I ordered this sampler because it is titled Flavored K-Cup Sampler. I ended up with only 6 out of the 24 are ""flavored"".

Not what I was expecting at all. I should have listened to the other negative reviews and not bought from this seller even after reading the seller's response to some of the negative feedback with promises to revise the way they fill orders. And if you are looking to give this as a gift, the cups come in a zip-loc bag, not that it mattered to me because I am using them in a gift basket. The only positive was the prompt shipping, I expected it tomorrow and it showed up a day early."	1	2

		A3TPN9G3FWW6FK	Had higher expectations	"It is a naturally sweetened soda with Stevia, but I expect more robust flavor simular to Dr. Pepper.  I wouldn't even say it is close to Dr. Pepper.  I was disappointed, especially when I love the ""Cola"" flavor of Zevia so much."	0	0
		A5CR6GP49HVEE	Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me	I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.	2	0
		A3DUGHDTBTWFJ	VERY LIGHT!	I mistakenly grabbed this Donut HOUSE blend at Costco thinking it was the Donut SHOP blend of k-cup (by Coffee People).  I realized it wasn't Donut SHOP the first time I made a cup.  It was REALLY light - basically colored water, very little flavor if made on the recommended 8 oz brew size.  Not much better on a lower setting either.  If you like a very, very mild coffee, then this is for you.  I'm not a fan of strong coffee, but this was WAY to mild and I'll be making sure I'm getting the Coffee People Donut SHOP coffee rather than Donut HOUSE in the future!	0	0
		A22I8C0O494K93	Sorbitol and Xylitol???	Why does the ingredients list prominently feature sorbitol and xylitol?  With the stevia, that's 3 sweeteners!!!  And sorbitol causes painful gas and bloating.  Want a gum sweetened ONLY with stevia.  Does that product exist?	8	0
		A14D5BEB1HEJ8M	Not working well at all	I bought this to use with goat milk.  First batch (1/2 batch so i didn't waste this expensive milk) was a failure but the milk was ultra-pasteurized so likely wouldn't work.  Tried 2nd batch (1/2 packet) with powdered goat milk and this actually turned out.  Only thing was I only made a 1/2 batch so was gone in 2 days. Excitedly made 3rd batch with powdered goat milk again and whole package of starter, and it did not thicken at all.  It is sour like the other two but not at all thickened like the middle batch.  I will likely try Kefir grains and see how those work out.  Really hate the fritzing with heating and cooling.  I found that to be a royal pain....	1	1
		A3A8NB11HSAXWP	Dogs love it, but be sure to give in moderation or you'll be sorry!	"I bought this with the Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug, since it was recommended that they go together.  I have two papillons - one loved the toy and was quite good at getting the treats out of the bottle rather quickly...while the other one waited and consumed what fell out.<br /><br />That being said, they consumed a fair amount of the treats.  Not a lot, but a good handful.  Since the product was recommended to go with the toy, I had assumed that it would be okay for them to have more than just one or two of these. The next day, when it was Potty Time, I noticed that their #2's were bright green, and a little ""loose"" (sorry for being so graphic).  My dogs don't eat table scraps or any people food - I feed them Science Diet puppy bites, with occasional training treats, and this is the first time I've ever noticed a problem with their BMs.<br /><br />They seem to like the taste of these, though they prefer others.  I would recommend mixing them with some other treats rather than using them consistently, or you'll be cleaning it up later.  I will probably continue mixing these in with other treats/kibble until I use up the bag, but will not purchase anymore in the future."	20	0
		A1WOMXOEX90ARI	Very Good Tea!!!	"While this may not be ""premium"" tea, it IS very good tea. It has a smooth, not harsh, yet bold flavor. It stands up well to milk or cream and makes a very good iced tea. After drinking this, Lipton's tea just seems so unbearably harsh and acrid. It brews up well, never seeming to become bitter. It works well as a general, all purpose, every day tea; also, blending well with mint or other flavors, like cinnamon, if that's what you like. PG is good black, too. It is a finely cut tea, BUT, so what? It steeps well and tastes great. The tea bags are pyramid shaped, which does seem to brew better, probably because more of the bag and tea is in the water and less is floating.  Also, there is more bag surface exposed to the water.  The material the bag is constructed of is different than the usual bag.  It is softer with a more open weave, so again, water flows through better.  It does not leave a slight taste of the bag, as some other brands do. I searched high and low, for years, and paid way too much for stale PG Tips before finding it on Amazon at a very good price, especially when purchased at subscribe and save prices. I do prefer the loose tea, but occasionally use tea bags, for traveling. There are other teas I enjoy, but this remains on my list of favorites, both for taste and price!"	1	0
		AD98ZJJY4Y6HM	Switched to a cheaper food, but going back to Canidae	We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food. Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we've had them on. It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for! When Amazon upped the price $10 a bag we switched to Diamond Naturals, but not only did their coats begin to lose their sheen, but that awful smelling gas came back as well!! We are putting them back on Canidae. It's worth it!!	2	0

		AQVWXGE0HX7ER	Lindt 70% RIP	"A few weeks ago, I sent a complaint to Lindt via their web site and did receive a very nice email  response.  It mirrored pretty much what the web site says about the overwhelming positive response.<br /><br />Here's the funny part:  I was in a Lindt store last week and complained about the recipe change.  The sales person said that they've been receiving numerous complaints from previously-happy 70% customers.  And yes, the reason for the change in taste is that the bar is being manufactured in the US now, with a soya emulsifier and less cocoa butter.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my email to Lindt...  I hope they don't have the same PR disaster Coca-Cola had when they ""improved"" their recipe."	5	0
		A36K2N527TXXJN	The true un-soda	The Switch Orange Tangerine is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure orange and tangerine juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it, you may never go back to regular sodas again. It works well by itself or with a meal. This may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids, as it is a much more nutritious drink. The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst.	3	0

The ""hot sauce"" is nothing but hot and I've had fewer bones in Shad.  There were a total of 3 ""sardines"", or whatever these were, in the can.  I kept an unopened bottle of Devil's Springs Vodka on hand for years for extreme remedy purposes and used it to get rid of the bio-solid waste taste this product left behind.  Funny - country of origin in USA, but is product of Thailand...  must be snakehead..?? Truly believe this is not Bluefin tuna so it's at least not contaminated with radiation from Japan.

In this illy issimo cappuccino, ingredients are listed as follows: coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan.<br /><br />I would have guessed this order: water, sugar, coffee, cocoa powder.

Label indicates Protein 4g and Calcium 10%, Total Fat 1.5 g (very good!), and Total Carb 19g (not so good for people on a low carb diet).<br /><br />This cappuccino was a nice late-afternoon energizer that motivated me to take a brisk one-mile walk.

		AUA6NUI5O7D50	TO DIE FOR!!!!	Oh my God, this is the best gluten free bread I've had in 12 years since my diagnosis.  That includes home made bread, disastrous flops from my breadmaker, down to the store-bought breads that taste like cardboard. It looks like real bread, smells like bread, tastes good (OK, fresh wheat bread from a bakery tastes better...) and you can even slice it thin.<br /><br />  This bread doesn't disintegrate into a handful of crumbs.  (Till now, I always had to eat a GF sandwich hunched over the sink to catch the crumbs.)  It makes great sandwiches, toast, cinnamon toast, toasted cheese sandwiches, BLT's, etc.  I even made a hamburger bun out of some of the dough.  The only failure so far was French Toast: it didn't absorb much of the egg and milk mixture.<br /><br />For Easter, I made a turkey with gluten free stuffing and gravy.  It was heaven on earth!  The whole family loved it, even though I was only Celiac in the bunch.<br /><br />I never bought this in the health food store because it was so expensive.  It's very affordable on Amazon prescheduled delivery.  I've been using Pamela's Baking mix for many years.  It's awesome.	0	0

		A2KPRZKM6CCO5G	WARNING - Contains Quinoa and WHOLE WHEAT	Please note that this product's ingredients contain whole wheat flour in addition to the quinoa.  In my opinion, the product listing is not clear about the inclusion of whole wheat.  The product photo is a small size and it is not mentioned in the product description.  Unless you see whole wheat in the ingredients list, you may think you are getting quinoa-only grain pasta (which Ancient Harvest also sells).  This could be a problem for those who are gluten-free.<br /><br />As for the cooking time, the instructions say 6-9 minutes, but as with other Ancient Harvest pasta products, I find that 12 minutes is the proper time for al dente noodles.<br /><br />Other than these quirks, Ancient Harvest quinoa pastas are a great alternative to traditional pasta varieties!	4	0
		ADSTKCE7IXB29	Why the white tea blend?	"I really cannot emphasize how disappointed I am with Celestial Seasoning's having ruined its perfectly good green tea. The company has apparently totally eliminated production of plain green tea in favor of blends with white tea. On the box it says ""with White Tea for Smooth Taste.""<br /><br />Smooth taste my foot -- the white tea bitters it.<br /><br />Can you imagine if you're a Folgers drinker 3 times a day for 10 years and then all of the sudden Folgers adds Essence of Municipal Garbage to its coffee?

		A2DWNAHNLA7NK7	Best cornbread I've ever tasted!	For years, I've been looking for cornbread like Mom used to make.  I've finally found it.  Pamela's cornbread mix has it all.  It's quick and easy to prepare and it tastes heavenly.  All the make-from-scratch recipes I've tried tend to be rather dry.  Pamela's cornbread is delightfully moist and it stays moist if you don't get it all eaten at once.  In fact, it's so moist it tastes good even without butter.  It has just the right degree of sweetness.  You can also make cornbread muffins from it and I've discovered they freeze well.  In addition, Pamela provides variations on the recipe if you're looking for something a little different.  I have no hesitation in giving this product a resounding five stars.  I like it so well I order it from Amazon in bulk.	5	0
		A2IYLMDQGBB4VG	decent tea	I gave up drinking coffee because I always added creamer and sugar, thus I have been trying lots of different teas. This is a decent flavored tea, though not on the top of my list. Wish you could mix and match a case.	0	1
		A2PYQGI9WYZ3J4	Very, Very Disappointing!	I have had Twinging's Lapsang Souchong in the U.K., and this is a totally differrent and inferior product.

Yuck!	2	1
		A2N2X7L7LB3S6X	Great Flavor....	I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.	0	0

		AF3BYMPWKWO8F	Warning: Contains Menadione	"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al.

		A3LX57I5OKG70V	Interesting taste	I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!	2	1
		A39O70DR5RQKSJ	Ok	"I saw this product on Oprah and wanted to try it, I was impressed that it was vegetarian and lower fat then mayo. I thought it would make good ""BLT's"", but without the real beacon. It was just OK for me. The product does come as described and tastes OK, but something about it just tasted too fake and I didn't like the texture. It's not real creamy lake mayo, or even low-cal mayo. I like low-cal fry sauce a lot better. I have to say though, it's just a taste thing, and someone else might love it. I still use it on burgers, (mixed with light mayo), but no one in my family really cares for it that much.<br />I wasn't happy that with free shipping it took a month before it was even sent out, that seemed a little ridiculous. The packaging was good. I like that the jars are plastic and not glass. However, I would not purchase again or recommend, because the flavor is just OK."	2	1
		A1SVO1B3CNJ7ZE	Quality Food	First thing I did was check the ingredients.  No wheat and no corn.  That's good.  The main ingredients are good animal protein sources.<br /><br />There were two flavors in the pack I received:  Chicken pot pie and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken smelled great!  I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.<br /><br />Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.  My cat didn't seem to mind so why should I?  He ate it all.<br /><br />Bottom line...good ingredients, cat likes it.  Five paws up.	0	0

		AK7EK8EMH744I	Not the greatest	I wish it were easy for me to get a picture up for this review. The reason is that the mint is gangly to the point that I have not yet harvested it and it has been six weeks. The Cilantro did not even sprout, never mind that one. The dill consists of five little sprites, not exactly harvestable either. The two plants that did well are the regular and the red basil. We have been eating those and they taste good. Overall, I'd say this thing is a mixed bag. It is very easy to do, yes absolutely. It allows you to grow plants all year long in a controlled environment, yes. Does it work? In mcase it does not, I'd say it is pretty bad that it comes advertised a certain way - beautful ful plants and then when you do it yourself and you follow all instructions you will absolutely not get the same results. Personally I think it is not worth it, and I'd gladly take a refund. By the way, the replacement capsules for your next batch are 20 dollars! How do you spell rip off? I'd stay clear from this one.	8	2

		A3HKCFUS9TYB1F	Like thick, cloyingly sweet sugar syrup	When you order mu shu pork at Chinese restaurant, you get WONDERFUL DARK RICH VERY-PLUM tasting sauce with it.

		AY54QSGO3KWEM	Super stuff!	I will add my kudos. When I opened my first bottle I was not really expecting much. Instead, I was greated by a delicous aroma, followed by a taste of wonderfully sweet, vanilla agave. As the other reviewers noted, this is not just agave syrup with some vanilla extract tossed in: you can see the specks of vanilla bean. I quickly used it in my fat-free ice cream recipe: very good indeed! (next time, however, I will use only the vanilla agave, and ignore putting in any vanilla extract which causes some bitter after-taste).<br /><br />I have given five stars to all three products made by this company. Check out the chocoagave and the 'bold roast' chocoagave.	1	0

		A292V1K7VLNQF0	Bold and Satisfying!	I like a fairly bold cup-o-joe and am completely satisfied with this blend in our machine.  I even brew it for the largest cup (12oz) and it tastes wonderful.  Other blends were too weak for me, but this one hits the spot!	2	1
		AZ1Z6EM4T09M8	QUALITY DECLINED	I had been getting this product on subscribe and save for over a year.  The first couple of shipments had great quality.  The food was in half inch squares with a thick gravy.  With the middle shipments the food was cut in little slices but still had a thick gravy.  The last shipment the food was mush with running gravy.  I cancelled my subscription.	5	1
		A2MUGFV2TDQ47K	Like it at Home NOT On-The-Go	"Loved the Fruit Punch flavor, all the vitamins, nutrients and ENERGY benefits A LOT. Liked the convenient, pre-measured one-squeeze delivery per 8 ounces of water. There are 24 squeezes/servings per bottle. Having these benefits being just a ""squeeze away"" are cool for my at-home life. At current price, $24 for 4 bottles it's $.25 per serving. It has ZERO calories due to the artificial sweetener sucralose - generic Splenda.<br /><br />I prefer the flexibility of pre-measured powder packet to add to my re-fillable water bottle while on-the-go. ME lugging COLORFUL liquids around IS a disaster waiting to happen. It didn't give more umph than my daily multi-vitamin with a cup of coffee."	0	0
		A3GRP8QRFGDH8T	Price cannot be correct	Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can.	1	3
		AXXLNL822BJBZ	Fluffy, but chewy	I bought these kernals about 2 months ago.  At first they were really fluffy, but after about a month of them being open they are now kind of chewy after being popped.  They still taste fresh which is great, and my popper is still able to pop all but 2 or 3 kernals.  I do think these kernals are worth the money but I will be trying a different brand the next time I purchase kernals.	0	0
		A3C4SGSZ0O5WJ8	Not as good as Senseo Paris French Vanilla	"I bought this to replace the Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee Pods that I like to use in my Hamilton Beach 1 cup pod brewer because the Senseo brand has been unavailable for quite some time.  Unfortunately, this is not as good.<br /><br />This review is mostly for those people who like a light to medium strength coffee, not the hard-core espresso drinkers.  I drink my coffee weak -- not super strong -- but also not watery.  My daily one cup of coffee is a treat I allow myself, and I use a smaller coffee mug (holds up to 8 ounces comfortably) so I don't need a lot of coffee, but, this coffee is extremely weak (even for me) and I have to be sure to use **no more than** 6 ounces of water with this brand, otherwise it is just too weak and watery.<br /><br />I've tried using 2 pods at a time to see if that would help but, oddly enough, even with 12 ounces of water per cup the coffee comes out too strong for my taste.  Plus, I just don't need or want more than one cup of coffee each morning.<br /><br />I've also noticed that this coffee has a very ""acidy"" aftertaste and tends to severely aggravate my heart burn which is not normally bothersome for me if I have only one (or rarely, two) cup(s) of coffee.  I also have had this problem with 'Folgers' brand coffee (the regular loose coffee) that we use in our large coffee maker if someone other than just me is having coffee.<br /><br />If you want a larger mug of coffee, you might be able to make this work for you by using 2 pods per mug of coffee.  It's just hasn't worked out for me.<br /><br />Note:  I have also tried Wolfgang Puck's ""Caramel Creme"" flavored coffee and it is a bit smoother without the acid aftertaste.  The caramel creme is much more like Senseo's Paris French Vanilla, but it still only makes a 6 ounce cup of coffee."	0	0

		A3AY0FKFYDNYI0	it is cheap caviar	let's face it not spending a lot on this caviar. It's going to taste like that. I would not recommend eating this caviar from the jar. It's not that kind of caviar. It is a little fishy, maybe more than other caviar's, but it's actually not a bad product altogether. I would recommend serving or using this caviar with things such as sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or some nicely selected crackers. I have even found a pretty good recipe for a tasty little appetizer using this type of caviar. I recommend it either looking for a good recipe or using extras to mask the extra fishy taste	5	1
		A1380QKOFMFB4E	So helpful	We have two Siberian Huskies and the oldest has to take medication every night. She hates the way it smells and will dig it out of anything else we try to hide it in - even cake.  But these are amazing.  We just put the capsule inside, push the treat together at the top, and she gobbles it up.  Completely masks the scent and both she and our younger dog actually beg for them as treats (yes, the younger dog also gets one every night, but without a pill inside).	1	0

		AMJUSIY9C1H4Y	my dog loves them	these are good for your dogs teeth.  they sell them at most vet offices for more.  the only complaint is the different sizes, some are bigger and thicker, while others are smaller.  i cut the bigger ones in half for my dogs	0	0
		ADUPZFIJT04ZP	Could be saltier, not gourmet, arrived melted	I agree with one reviewer that I'd like a little more salt. Mine arrived very melted, in one giant clump. They are very sticky so it was quite messy to eat them. I do live in a warm climate so I kind of expected to have that issue. They taste pretty good but if you are looking for a gourmet sea salt and caramel candy, you won't be thrilled with these. I tried a sea salt caramel in a wine store and was amazed, it was delicious but a package of only 5 candies was very pricey so I ordered these. Next time I think I'll just spend the money for a smaller amount of really good quality caramels. These are much better than the caramels you can buy in a grocery store, just not quite salty enough for me.	3	0
		A26OLQWKE8P9ZT	Yuck!	This is by far the worst coffee creamer I have ever used.

		A1A763Q8427ZGY	Expensive, but it worked!	"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all."	5	0
		A2ONQB6UPXHN1V	Great if you like treats for home decorations rather than food	I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.	0	0

		AMA7VWGAKO6X5	Great...when it doesn't break! Good Customer service.	I got this baby food maker off of my baby registry. I wanted to make my baby's food so I knew what was going into his mouth. Well, it worked great the first few times and then the plastic broke off the bottom of the container that holds the metal pin in (holding in the blade.) I was able to rig it so that it still worked anyways. Then, a couple days later while making a batch of prunes, the motor went out! Well, surely this was designed to handle something a little thicker like prunes.<br /><br />So, I called and emailed the baby brezza company. About a week later, they did call me and ended up sending me a brand new machine for no charge to me. But, in the meantime I steamed the food in my steamer and used my food processor. I loved that SO much more because I could do large batches. So, I think I may return the brezza. If you want to make food in tiny batches, this would be great. But, I found that a food processor and steamer are much more efficient for large amounts of food to freeze. So, 3 stars (being generous) for the machine and 5 stars for their customer service if it breaks :)	1	1
		A1BN0UHVH2VYLQ	Great full-fat pb substitute	If you're like me, then you LOVE peanut butter so much that you can't really keep it in the house.  The 'real' stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost.  PB2 is a great alternative.  It's not exactly the same taste as a commercial product, but it's close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference, and if you do, just imagine how much fat you're not eating!<br /><br />One of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want, just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process.  I find that makes it a very versatile product for cooking when I want to make a peanut sauce, or when I put it on apples and want it a bit thicker than the standard ratio delivers.<br /><br />Also, the fact that is has to be mixed up short circuits the spoon-to-mouth pattern that made it impossible for me to keep the 'real' stuff in the house.<br /><br />The only real down side is that because it's a powder there is no 'crunchy' version, but I suppose you could chop up peanuts and mix them in if you wanted to.	3	0

		AWVQXPFDYQ32L	Really Bitter Bad Coffee.. I Was Shocked after reading all the great reviews	Really Bitter Bad Coffee.. I Was Shocked after reading all the great reviews. I ordered based on the reviews.. I dont understand. Did I get a bad batch? I soend over 50.00 for Lavazza Crema e Aroma Coffee Beans, 2.2-Pound Bag and the Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag. Both bags were sealed. The coffee didnt smell unique or great but I was optimistic. I have a really great espresso machine and have been making my own espresso for over 10 years. I ground it fine same as I always do. I tasted it straight no sweetener , just to get the true taste , very bitter , even after adding splenda , didnt even taste like coffee , just a bitter not too strong coffee taste. Its not even drinkable , no joy. Ill not take reviews at their face value anymore..<br /><br />Im a HUGE AMAZON FAN .. I think amazon has the best return policy , i dont use it much but they really know how to treat their customer. I love the 2-Day air shipping , they really go out of their way to treat every customer like they really want us to come back .. Good Job Amazon :)	1	3
		A1JHPMSXHHOMI	"Are you sure this isn't ""light?"""	Yes I am reviewing the Traditional Clam Chowder. Now I have never been to New England but I assume they, like most New England Clam Chowders, actually include Clam in their soup. There are a few tiny pieces but they are few and far between and resemble TVP in both texture and taste. I cannot recommend this product.	1	0
		A3A50F3ZWJ6V68	This coffee is now DECAFF!	One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered.	9	0

		AS3IE5GWHMRSF	It's good once you doctor it up a little bit!	I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both. I actually haven't used it as a shake, but I use it to make protein pancakes. I find I have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet. At first I came out with some really awful pancakes, but after I found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up, they all come out amazing!!! So if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy, I definitely think this is a good choice!	1	0
		AET2BRH3JRW7J	Tasty but Crumbly - Eat them with a spoon!	Like many have said, these cookies are really tasty.  I love the flavor.  I'm only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled.  The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked.  That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting.  I eat them with a spoon! They'd probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that.  I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela's fixes the recipe so they don't crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact). I've tried several of Pamela's cookies and this is the only one that was COA (crumbs on arrival) :-)	0	0

This particular flavor is lacking, however.  ""Habanero BBQ"" should be spicy -- habanero is the hottest pepper available, after all.  Yet these are more sweet and tangy than actually spicy.  They weren't awful, but they certainly didn't live up to the excellence of some of the other flavors, like wasabi or jalapeno smokehouse. If you like the idea of a tangy bbq snack, than this might be what you're looking for.  Just don't expect it to be spicy!"	0	0

		AOEW3ERRG9UGN	Pretty good for stevia	For someone who is trying to slowly switch over from regular diet sodas/drinks to all natural diet substitutes, I have tried a variety of stevia flavored drinks (aka stevia sweetened sodas and teas). This my first time trying a powdered drink. And it's better than what I expected. I was bit wary after reading some of the reviews. You can add just a little bit and it's enough to sweeten my tea or just water. I am not a fan of drinking water (except fiji or while working out) and this can easily quench my thirst when I add the right amount. If I add too much its a mix between bitter and sweet and it's not that good. It's something I add for flavour and a great alternative for a healthy diet nut who likes tasty drinks. I would like to try the orange so I can add it to tea and make it DIY iced orange tea.	0	0

The problem is almost assuredly me, not the juice, as I don't deal well with cider either.  I'm giving the juice a three mostly as a warning to others who have the same tendency.

		A2B1HA8FJ7MK0	Feh	"I've got nothing new to say here; I'll just pile on with the rest.<br />The texture is ... friable. It's loose granular granola. The clusters have de-clustered. This doesn't bother me.<br />The acrid aroma does bother me. It smells like a drying oil portrait. In other words, like rancid linseed. This odor accompanies each spoonful down your gullet. If you care about healthy-eating things, you wonder about the oxidative-stress, anti-health effects of rancid fats as you finish your bowl, because this stuff is expensive and there's no way you're gonna waste it, free radicals or not.<br />Several have commented on the price. Note that it's gluten-free. If you had to eat gluten-free all the time (and I do), you'd be accustomed to this kind of gouging: $6 loaves of bread, $7 frozen pizzas, and now, $6, 11-oz bags (that's about 3 or 4 bowls IRL) of gluten-free granola. ""Gluten-free,"" translated into English, means ""Give me your money.""  Celiacs' diets are limited to what's available, and a lot of it isn't very satisfying.<br />Fortunately there are many other less expensive and less rancid tasting cereals/granolas available.<br />Because I feel sort of bad for KIND, I will say here that I like their nut- and fruit-based bars very much.<br />[You may or may not be interested in the following: Oats by themselves are gluten-free. However, commercial oats sold on the world market are extensively contaminated with gluten-containing wheat, rye and barley, and are therefore not suitable for a gluten-free diet - this includes grocery store oatmeal and products made with oats. However, in the past 8 or so years, oats have been grown in dedicated fields using scanned seeds, and the crop tested for gluten. These are known in the celiac world as ""gluten-free oats."" These GF oats cost about five times as much as regular oats, and are the type used in KIND, friable, cinnamon-linseed granola.]"	0	0
		A13M6GBEM7JJOL	Don't knock it til ya try it.	You'd be surprised how much Runa Tea can help you in your daily life. Thirsty or not, Hot or cold, this tea can help you in many ways. As a college student studying to be an entrepreneur, I can't just take prescribed drugs all the time to keep my attention span up. Instead, I turn to caffeine all day every day. Runa Tea has been one of the few products that have really caused me to feel refreshed as if I was just hydrated after a run, as well as feeling focused as if I were ready to write a 10 page paper from scratch. I don't know what it is, but it just makes you feel good in every way. Personally, I love the cold tea- but as a consumer everyone needs to find their niche, as I am a huge hot tea drinker and chose the cold version- Either way, same thing.  You need to try it. And then try and contradict our 5 star opinions! :)	1	0

		A21YC6U1S1DPDQ	Look at the ingredients list - this has more sugar by weight than it has almonds	"I am all for nut and grain milks and have been drinking them for 12 years.  I am now looking for a good almond milk but unfortunately this one is not going to be it.  I think that this company's large cartons (half gallon) of organic almond milk have more almonds than sugar, but unfortunately these small cartons seem to not be made of organic almonds, and, more importantly to me, seem to hardly be almond milk at all, but rather water and sugar with some almond flavoring (according to the ingredients list).  Also, they add ""other natural flavorings"" which I try to avoid because usually that's food-industry-speak for msg and stuff like that, which gives me headaches.  I understand that the company wants to make this drink more palatable to children and to reluctant health-nuts, but I think it's the wrong way to go to put more sugar than almonds in it, and the wrong way to go to add all kinds of ""flavoring"" when almonds are so beautifully flavored on their own.  I wanted this to be a product I could order from Amazon, but I'll need to keep looking."	47	1
		A24EI07FMP7DGH	Ghee-tastic!	I really, really like this ghee. Not sure if I love it yet. All I know that my food doesn't burn as fast. For All-Clad frying pan owners, you will love this. Food does not stick and burn onto the frying pan so clean up is much faster. Not sure if there is a taste difference from my previous ghee but the grass-fed component does make it seem better. 4 golden brown french toasts out of 5.	3	0
		A23MDA823G0MSQ	Very poor tea	I bought 3 bags of this tea and found each to be just as bad as the last.  This tea has a very weak/poor flavour.  I tried to brew it very stong but it still ends up tasting bad.	0	1
		A13MKSASQ6YWL7	Tasty but relatively high in calories	This is a tasty drink that is all natural.  However, a small 8.3 ounce can contains a relatively high 140 calories which is roughly the same number of calories in a 12 ounce Coke.  Only, a Coke is about 50% larger in volume.<br /><br />I like sweet, but to me this is a bit too sweet.  It might be nice as a mixer in an adult beverage though.  I haven't tried to mix it, but you could probably make a nice fruity alcoholic drink out of it.<br /><br />The price isn't a bargain.  At nearly $1 per can, as of this writing, it wouldn't seem to be a compelling value.  I do like it, but I doubt I'd purchase it again.  It also left a bit of a lingering metallic aftertaste that I wasn't thrilled about.  Still, if you don't mind the calories, enjoy a beverage that is sweet and are looking for a natural drink, then this could be worth considering.	0	0
		A1C7ATCT9XSEZ2	AWESOME!	This chocolate is delicious! The dark chocolate has a good flavor and is not very sweet, but the fruit adds a delicious sweet flavor as your chewing. AWESOME! I hope it ends up being cheap on Amazon when it becomes available!	0	0
		A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ	Green with white edgings	"I ordered 2 Reverse Variegated Spider Plants on May 5, 2012 and they arrived four days later on May 9, in 4"" round plastic pots.  Plants were packaged with recyclable peanuts.<br /><br />The plants look the same as pictured on the internet with green leaves and white edgings on both sides.  One plant has two inflorescenses (stems or branches) and the other has three inflorescenses.  The plants are small to medium sized.  Both have healthy and thick roots throughout the bottom, with one having roots poking through the holes so I put both into larger pots for continued growth.  Overall, they are very nice looking and healthy plants and I am very happy with them.<br /><br />July 13, 2012 Update<br /><br />As usual with Spider Plants, these are growing fast.  They just need some sun and water.  On July 11, I split one into three plants.<br /><br />October 1, 2012<br /><br />All Spider Plants are doing great.  They are very easy to grow.  Today, I gave away a baby I rooted."	1	0
		A2EPN31OIXTWRF	Disappointed	We have enjoyed Godiva chocolates for over 20 years, and so it is painful to say goodbye to such a good old friend.<br />However, the product is no longer what it once was. The flavors are bland, the variety is not there any more, and it is just disappointing to spend so much and receive so little. There are now better options elsewhere.	1	1
		A2KADAQBR8NG80	Very Tasty	I love this coffee. I do wish it came already ground as I don't have a grinder and use a blender instead. But it's worth it. Many flavored coffees I've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn't reach the coffee, but this one manages both.	0	0
		A2I9G7W32MNH4N	May contain high levels of arsenic	"I researched many formulas before purchasing this one because it seemed the MOST organic and safe for my baby. On 2/16/12 Consumer Reports published research indicating that formulas containing organic brown rice syrup -- the first ingredient in Baby's Only formula -- have high levels of arsenic.<br /><br />From Consumer Reports: ""Two of 17 infant formulas tested listed organic brown rice syrup as the primary ingredient. One had a total arsenic concentration that was six times the federal limit of 10 parts per billion (ppb) for total arsenic in bottled or public drinking water. This is particularly worrisome for babies because they are especially vulnerable to arsenic's toxic effects due to their small size and the corresponding arsenic consumption per pound of body weight.""<br /><br />It did not list the brands of formula, but to be safe I will not be feeding this formula to my child.<br />[...]"	6	2
		A1IVFBJA9KAI1M	Tasty!	The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!	2	1

		A11OQUV1ZI2MT2	Didn't Really Taste Like a Latte	"I tried this product and it really didn't taste much like latte or even any kind of coffee.  I had to look up latte on the Internet to make sure I wasn't missing something.  The generally accepted definition of latte seems to be strong coffee with steamed milk.  When I checked the ingredients on this package the first ingredient was sugar, followed by nondairy creamer.  The first ingredient in the non dairy creamer was corn syrup solids.  The third ingredient was partially hydrogenated coconut oil. Coffee was actually the ninth ingredient, listed behind dipotassium phosphate, artificial flavor, and maloxdextrin, which explains why it didn't taste much like coffee.  I do think it is a misnomer to have latte on the front of this package.  I guess in smaller print they have the words ""naturally and artificially flavored cafe-style beverage"" so technically that is how they are defining their product. But in larger letters are the words Maxwell House and International Latte so I was really expecting something coffee tasting. Anyway the product doesn't really taste like latte or coffee at all.  It really just mainly tasted like hot sugar water with a few other kind of odd flavors thrown in.<br /><br />I think for the money I would stick with something more healthy and natural like black or green tea or even just real coffee with real milk added in."	4	2

		AFUDLZ0NRLICR	A Disappointment	I am a huge organic products enthusiast, and I am a fan of Amy's products. I bought this soup in hopes of it having some sort of pizzaz. I was sorely disappointed.<br />After having heated it up, I tasted it and was shocked with how bland it was. It was a meek soup, almost as if they created a black bean base, tossed some veggies in and left it at that. Uh...where are the spices?! The herbs?! The excitement!<br />Only after adding some hot sauce, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, and sour cream did the soup become worthy to be eaten with the rest of my lunch.<br />If you are a fan of more mild soups, this could be for you. If you're just a fan of plain veggie soups, this certainly could be for you. But if you like a little jazz in your soup, don't buy this unless you're ready to dump a jar of salsa in.	4	1
		A1VZYBIWBR8QBW	True turkish apricots	I love apricots and have been fortunate to have travelled to Turkey and had real Turkish dried apricots.  While traveling there I had found there were definite differences in size, taste, quality and freshness.  These imported Turkish apricots are very good quality with excellent flavor and consistency.  Having read the previous reviews I was concerned about the packaging, however they came in perfect shape.  They are very well packaged - six clear plastic tubs arrived in their own cardboard box (like a six-pack of bottled beer) covered in clear plastic all around, and packaged again in amazon's usual box with air pillows.  if the tubs get broken, then the two boxes they are all contained in have to get crushed as well.  A great product and I will gladly purchase them again.	0	0
		A1UQBFCERIP7VJ	illy issimo caff&egrave;	Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the illy issimo cappucino as a treat.	0	0

		A3A1OA237FOZFK	Would rate about 2.5	"Since we cannot assign half star ratings, I have to say I would give this product a 2.5 which rounds to 3 stars.  This is probably one of my least favorite of the available flavors available for the Dolce Gusto coffee machine.  I personally am not a ""frou-frou"" coffee/latte expert by any means, so my rating is based on my own personal experience with just this product.  I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer/milk, so I am probably a little more biased when it comes to rating something like this.<br /><br />I have to agree with another reviewer who said this coffee looks better than it tastes.  I mentioned in a review of another flavor that I don't care too much for the milk, and I think that may be what primarily affects my opinion of this particular flavor; I find it too has an aftertaste and even a powder-like feel.  I do not feel that the available hot chocolate version suffered from this as much."	1	1
		A2EPPPDY6L8T4B	Great product, BUT!	"Great product, BUT!!!!! It's a little tricky to figure out the best time needed for YOUR microwave oven. Ours is pretty strong, and 1 minute 40 to 50 seconds is about right. However, BE WARNED! If you have an inexpensive or ""low power"" oven, the results will be very poor at best. (Just ask the crew where I work) When I tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven, it was SUPER slow to expand, and after the better part of 4 minutes, the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the break room open for the rest of the afternoon! Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling. Otherwise they will seem stale until they cool. All this sounds like a pile of work, but after the first couple bags, you will NEVER buy pork rinds at the store again. I get a discount on the price because I have a box sent automatically every month. Works out to just under $13.00 a box with free shipping. Enjoy!"	0	0
		A1RQ3W2KO7GJDF	Good Product, Tastes Great	I bought this thinking I could eliminate the liquid creamer I buy from the store and save money.  However because its sweetened, the people in my house pump until it tastes the way they want it to instead of pumping for the cream and adding sugar like we did with the liquid coffee mate.  All in all, we almost used the whole bottle within a week.  (Between 3 adults, we probably drink about 12 cups of coffee a day.)<br /><br />Like the other reviewers have stated, when the bottle gets close to the end, there is quite a bit left and you can't get it out without cutting open the bottle and pouring it in the coffee or transferring it into another container. That SUCKS!<br />I have not had an issue with the pump getting stuck...Probably because we use it every day.<br /><br />Other Comments:  The creamer came with a tip on it that points the stream of cream downward (not pictured with the bottle.)  I still have to do some testing however I'm not sure if 1 pump with the tip equals 1 liquid creamer cup as pictured on the bottle.  I do know that three pumps with the tip on it equals 1 tablespoon, so I'm able to get an accurate calorie count. (Unless you at 's way down the bottle and the pump won't pump out.)  I also need to figure out if at all there are any cost savings compared to just buying the big bottle of liquid creamer and using sweetner.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy it again for the following reasons:  Taste great, quick, easy calorie counting, and no refrigeration needed so my coffee stays hot.	0	0
		A2ZVIZRVMBXAN0	Wrong Item sent....can't figure out where to deal with this issue.	"Ordered six ""hairball formula"" bags of cat food.

There must be a simpler way to notify that you've received the wrong item.<br />Usually Amazon is much more responsive.<br /><br />Also...the packaging is awkward.

		A3938DJMZF0OQC	"Far from ""natural"""	"This coconut water is completely disgusting. I normally buy brands like O.N.E. and Vita Coco, but it has been hard to find them in stock recently. I've seen Zico, so when it went on sale at a local store I decided to try it. I didn't take the time to check the ingredients because I assumed it was like the other brands, pure coconut water.<br /><br />First off, this is ""from concentrate"". They defend this on their website, but don't be fooled. It affects taste, quality, and nutrition.<br /><br />Second, they add ""natural flavors"". There is nothing ""natural"" about a ""natural flavor"". It tastes fake and has a nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />This is by far the WORST coconut water on the market and I hope they will listen to consumers and actually make it ""natural""."	4	0
		A30NLW10BZXE66	If I had known...	Let me first say that this is the 1st time I have ordered raw cocoa in any form.  However, had I known that I would not be able to make it into a very fine powder for smooth cramy recipes, I would have ordered the powder instead.  The taste is really rich and great, but if you need to use it in recipes you want very silky and smooth...don't order this use this. Use the powder instead.  I will say the bags are huge, the price is AWESOME you will not find it cheaper ANYWHERE.	13	5

		A3UXLDXN4A6AVH	Not even CLOSE to Lemon Coolers	These are absolutely terrible! I remember Lemon Coolers. These are a complete joke. They taste like fat. OK, grease. Whatever.  Absolutely no zing, no lemon flavor at all. Kroger has just come out with a lemon cookie - can find them in the same area as Vanilla Wafers, as that's pretty much what they look like.  They are a lot more lemony and flavorful in general, and my resourceful fiancee took a few and spritzed them with water, rolled them in confectioner's sugar, and they were a LOT closer to the original Lemon Coolers than these ridiculous discs of disappointment.	1	2
		AN92S28RV1FQ4	Big deal: it's high in fructose.	Like high-fructose corn syrup, which is the bane of the health-food crowd, Agave syrup is a low glycemic sweetener simply because it has a high concentration of fructose and a low concentration of glucose. The health pitch is a bit of flim-flam.<br /><br />Agave syrup is about 90 percent fructose, which is at least double the percentage of fructose in commonly used high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The HFCS used in soft drinks and other foods ranges from 42 percent to 55 percent fructose. There is no evidence that increasing the amount of dietary fructose is a health benefit, and some evidence that it may increase fat around the mid-section, which is most associated with coronary artery disease.<br /><br />If you need a nutritious sweetener, molasses is by far the best choice. It is loaded with calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, and other good things. Granted, molasses might not be suitable for all sweetening needs, but when it is suitable it dwarfs agave in nutritional value.<br /><br />Be sure to read the accompanying comments to learn about the hazards of Agave.	27	14

		A2S1SEMBU2ZVH0	Not worth it!	I bought this product today hoping to amuse my chew-loving dog. But after unwrapping the packaging, I was disappointed.

I left it out for him 24 hours before I decided not to let him starve, so I went back to his old food. I don't know why he doesn't like it. The food itself is kind of funny looking: the meat particles look like exploded, freeze dried chunks. Artificial looking. There are regular, round, colored morsels representing the vegetable part of the mix. I can't really comment on the rest of it. Never seen him reject a dog food before.	0	0
		A2DPODMJ1G3E4H	Broken pods, stale coffee, not like espresso at all	These obviously don't sell well, the box I got had several broken pods and coffee grounds all over the place.  Just made a cup, had to throw it away.  Contacted Amazon and they gave me a refund even though the 30 days had passed.  Buy the Dark Roast instead; it tastes much better, is fresher and obviously sells better so they rotate stock more often.  I still had a little of the Dark Roast left, just compared the two, it's not even close.  Bottom line...1 star for this coffee, 5 stars for Amazon customer service...so a 3 overall I s'pose...	0	1
		A101P2KHWCU0G6	Toasted Corn and Rice for Cats!	I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!	0	2
		AHNDF9WRNDE9P	GREAT HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE DIET CONSCIOUS!	I love this Nestle hot chocolate but have only been able to find it in the supermarkets for about $3.69 for eight servings.  When I came across these canisters at this great price, I immediately ordered it.<br /><br />It's a satisfying hot chocolate which has only 25 calories and comes out to just pennies a serving.  I highly recommend it.	0	0
		A14WNZ8T1YITTT	great product, worth every penny	I've struggled with sleep and muscle tension for years and was introduced to this power powder by a great friend (thanks hil!) who said it worked for her.  From day one, it's worked incredibly well.  I don't feel drugged or sedated, just relaxed.  I agree that it's pretty sweet and strong as far as flavor, but hey, I can deal!  Careful: it does fizz up quite a bit and can easily overflow a glass if left unchecked.  I'm really thankful to have this product as a natural alternative to the myriad of pharmacological sleep aids.  No dependence, no withdrawal, just great, relaxed, restful sleep.  Mazel tov, Natural Calm!!	10	2
		A1VI6VD0R5O6Z8	dogs just didn't like it!	I have 4 dogs and nobody wanted to eat this... I'm sure it's great quality, but I want my dogs to eat something they like... I will stick with my royal canin! 3 Stars because the package is a thick zip-lock.	3	0
		A212B4HST8SVLY	Lipton Loose Tea	I love the Loose Tea. The bag tea has a harsh taste compared To the loose tea. If you drink more than 1 cup a day use a CLEAN (never used for Coffee) Coffee pot. Small 4 cup pots only need 1 tea spoon for weaker a little more for stronger tea.	1	0
		A36DS1EIECPDPO	Can't live without this cat food	Have been using this cat food now for a few years after the vet recommended dental cleaning (very expensive & put them under anesthesia - no way!).  Our cat is healthy and her teeth seem to be in good condition.  She loves the taste and size.  She won't eat any small food anymore (I have tried some samples) and actually eats all the Science Diet and leaves the small ones for me to discard.  It's a bit pricey but I would recommend it.	1	0
		A2NVDIXUP9E6BW	Excellent dark coffee...	"I think what I like about the Dark Magic blend is that it has a slight complexity in its flavor that isn't there in just regular ""bold"" or dark roast coffees, at least none of the k-cups I've tried.  Some people here and there insist that it's terrible, but I guess that's just how it goes with varying tastes.  It didn't come off to me to be over acidic or any of that stuff, and I'm usually pretty picky and sensitive about my coffee.  The flavor is definitely at its peak with an 8oz brew maximum, but you can still make 10-12oz cups without really losing much of the quality.  I love it."	0	0
		A2QNSS2ZP7X3Z3	Terrible	There was no expiration date on the package or on any of the individual packs. The gum tasted like it had been sitting around for too many years. Wish I could return it.	3	0

		A1XL5L0AQXPCKB	Ultimate hippy corn chips? Not! No organic corn!	Thats right, the 'ultimate hippy corn ships' are not made with organic corn which means it is most likely it's made with GMO corn. Not cool and amazingly they have never used organic corn. Why not? Most of the other health food type chips have always used organic corn. Why not the one with the hippy label? No excuses, I'd rather pay an extra 50 cents and get it right.	0	0
		A4902TQB4NGRJ	Worst Cocoa Ever	Nestle makes some seriously lousy cocoa. If you can taste any cocoa or mint in this bland product, you don't have a human tongue. The drink you're supposed to enjoy smells exactly like bales of hay. And twenty seven clams? Does it come with shares of stock in the company?	2	2
		A1FY4NUEN1MEFD	Great for traveling	I brought them for my trip to Europe. The hotels in Europe usually have a kettle, but only instant coffee power. It was wonderful to be able to have a real cup of coffee in my room!

I treat my self to a case of 6 boxes about once a month and it's SOOO hard not to order twice or even three times a month. Thank you AMAZON!!!!!!! There's nothing that I can't think of that I can't find on Amazon and their prices are always competitive at the very least and often times, cheaper than when found on other merchant sights. As for the product. Nabisco stopped making these Biscos some time ago and due to an increased demand, they began making them again. Amazon was the ONLY place I could find them.	0	0
		A1EOF9V4Q7Z9UT	Nutiva Coconut Oil	Great substitute for butter on cinnamon toast or over vegatables.  Also makes an easy substitute when baking calls for butter or vegatable oil.

		AK8S3SXO3CX9Y	Yuck ...	"this has got to be the absolute WORST microwave popcorn I have EVER had.  Lots of unpopped kernels.  The ""butter"" was more like ""seized"" glop (warm, lumps of lard).  I threw out the first bag after eating a small handful.  I took the rest of the order to work for those who appreciate this type of thing.  It didn't disappear very quickly, so maybe I am not the only one that thinks Orville Redenbacher's is a HUGE WASTE of money."	0	1

		A361PLXEWB9UC1	reallllllly good	first of all -- they're good.  really good.  go back for more and lick the bowl when they're gone - good.<br /><br />That said -- they're not quite as bold as you might hope.  I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.<br /><br />And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.	3	0
		A3R7HR0EK89C72	Good Breakfast Option	After reading the reviews I was slightly nervous about how this product would taste, but I found that when mixed with fruit and ice in the food processor it wasn't so bad. That being said it isn't delicious either, it's just okay and as tastes will differ you kind of have to try it and see. Also I didn't notice any increase in energy, but if I drink it for breakfast I often feel hungrier throughout the day as if it jump starts my metabolism. Overall, I like this shake as an option for breakfast it provides nutrients without weighing me down and tends to make me want to eat throughout the day, which is good for me because otherwise I wouldn't.	1	0
		A2YB7DLC3FOR7W	Cute Halloween Novely Beverage!	"Obviously this is a just a Halloween gimmick, or novelty beverage, and not something most people are going to stock up on to serve all the time.  The beverage powder, when mixed with hot water,  creates an orange-flavored  hot beverage.  It's supposed to taste like hot chocolate, but tastes more like a mild coconut flavored beverage to me.  It's a pleasant taste, actually.<br /><br />This Amazon deal offers three metal canisters with Peanuts characters on it.  The canisters aren't all that large, and each canister makes about 6 cups of ""hot chocolate,"" again, not such a bargain.<br /><br />A cute Halloween novelty; worth purchasing at a discount price.  At full price I'd probably pass."	5	0

		A1Z54EM24Y40LL	Not his favorite.....	I'm not sure why my guy doesn't like these sliced varieties for the most part, he loves them in the Friskies general line, but not these.  This one also has liver in it which may be why - he absolutely hates liver.  I recommend these for their great nutritional value but again, mine didn't care for the taste at all.  I've tried it on him more than once since he loves beef in general (loves it raw too!), so this one is a total mystery to me.  Recommend but with the above experience.	0	0
		A28WD4FHXY3P92	Don't Waste Your Money	"I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing ""straw grabber"" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)"	2	1
		A310A1T4NPBRQ6	Better than the real thing!	Anyone who has gone vegan or vegetarian knows how much you miss tacos. I tried this and I just can't believe how good it is! I made hard shell tacos with this today and soy cheese and I just can't believe how fabulous it tastes. The falafel this company makes is pretty good too!<br /><br />Please don't ever stop making this stuff! None of my carnivore family can even tell this is soy....If you are on the fence about this, don't hesitate-try it! The people who are saying it's too salty are entitled to their opinion, but this has no more salt in it than any other taco I've had in my life.	0	0
		A2CDVLXZHN6ZDH	Bring Back Subscribe & Save!	My husband and I fell in love with these Orgain shakes.  They are absolutely delicious and we each ordered our favorite flavor on Subscribe & Save and were thrilled with the product and the price.

With the price through the roof as it currently is, we will not be buying them here.	1	0

		A29NDSA4LMOWUL	Gluten Free, but also vitamin free?	"This cereal tastes great, and it is hard to find many items that the kids will eat.  However, I was surprised when looking at the label, that most of the nutrition content only improved slightly by adding milk.  Otherwise, there is no nutritional content to justify this as ""healthy"".  Be sure to check the label before ordering, I wish I had.  There are other things that are gluten free, that would provide more nutritional value."	0	6
		A1FUDD4U3S5GCA	works but does not have enough gain	using it for recording vocals on home PC using Shure C606 mic. It is a big improvement over the mic to stereo in for sure.. There is no background noise which was very prevailant in the mic in method. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the gain. Even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough. But overall a great product.. do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well.	1	0
		A3TPJHSSAGG140	Great treats for training	These treats are really small (maybe a quarter-inch square), so I can give them frequently to reinforce behavior.  My dog goes nuts for them, much more so than for any larger treat I've given her.  They keep well in a sealed container, although they do dry out if you leave them open for a long time.  The dog doesn't seem to mind, though.	0	0
		A33PLZ7SD5MCG0	Works better than Airborne	After having not so good results with taking Airborne to prevent catching colds and flus, I started taking Emergen-C. Each time during the past 2 years when a family member has caught something, I immediately started taking Emergen-C and have successfully not caught anything they had.<br /><br />Before, I managed to always get at least one cold or flu each season. But since I started taking Emergen-C, I have not suffered from any. It works great, and since it comes in so many flavors, it's easy to find a flavor that's right for you.	0	0

		A3LGOY7YGZN3OG	Darn good, but...	I grew up in an Italian household. Pasta was the staff of life. Being a celiac, not a good thing. So, I'm grateful for this linguine. It's the best I've tried of the gluten free stuff. No, it's not indistinguishable from normal noodles, and it can't hold a candle to my home-made pasta, but it's good enough to eat. It's not cheap, even in quantity it costs at least three times as much as wheat pasta,  but that's still doable, and the alternative of never having a dish of linguine with clam sauce, or my home made red sauce, well, I'll wince and pay.	1	0
		A3KTVXSMCWP0XQ	Easy popcorn	"I'm happy to say that in this case a pretty package equals yummy popcorn. The freshness is just what you would hope to receive and it is easy to use. It's a little salty if you pour in the entire seasoning packet (I guess it is better to have too much than not enough).<br /><br />The popcorn has a slighly sweet taste with an acceptable amount of ""old maids"".  It is definately better than the popcorn I had before and I'd purchase this again.  Finally, this review is for the 4oz package."	0	1

		A24X8P2TG2AR02	Dry, Hard, Bad	Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies, some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags. The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent/normal size but they really are a bit smaller. Case they are shipped in is great for storage, in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase. Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though...unless you like dark, crumby hard ones.	0	0
		A37HCYJX1CTSF3	DO NOT PURCHASE THESE STRIPS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE!!!	BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1,200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to amazon, but they don't accept edibles..<br /><br />I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe bloody vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation!<br /><br />I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is, if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged amazon to pull these off the website, before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs, maybe this batch was just the contaminated one? Either way, you don't want to take that chance with your beloved pooch! Please stay away! I don't even care if I lost my money on this order, you can't put a price on your best friend! I just want everyone's dogs to be safe! Vitality brand dog strips are toxic!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I just found out Mellow Mut and Vitality dog chews are made in China and manufactured by the same company Dogswell! I will never EVER purchase their products again! I'm reporting them to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration!	15	4
		A2C10VHHV4HYZU	So disappointing!	This sad confection is a perfect example of why you shouldn't do your grocery shopping while you're hungry. It was a total impulse buy and i was REALLY excited about it. No eggs? No dairy? Hooray a cookie for vegans like me! It sounded perfect. When i got home and took a bite i was SO disappointed. There's hardly any lemon flavor to it and it sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. It was like trying to swallow paste. I tried a few more bites to give it a fair chance ... but wound up throwing the majority of the cookie in the trash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i paid over $2 for this darn atrocity. Ah well... lesson learned.	3	3
		ANBJNY2KUWGT3	CONTAINS GMOs	My daughter is almost a year old and still breastfeeding. However, I had to have emergency breast surgery when she was 3 months old and she had to take some formula off and on during that time. I chose the Earth's Best brand because I like all of their other products. She seemed to tolerate it fine and we had no issues. Imagine my shock reading the Organic Consumers' email newsletter just now informing me that Earth's Best formula was found to have genetically engineered neutraceuticals (in the DHA). Apparently, Horizon Organic milk does too, which is very angering....if you ask me, if a component of a product has to be GENETICALLY ENGINEERED, that product is clearly not 'organic' and shouldn't carry the organic labeling.<br /><br />The only thing I will say is that the Earth's Best brand is a good brand, and I'm sure this product is still much better than all the conventional brands.....I would still pick this over regular infant formula any day....however, the organic label is misleading in a product that apparently contains GMOs. I don't want GMOs anywhere near my developing child, and until law passes that all GMO food be labeled, I guess you can't even trust organic food now. Buyer beware.	6	2
		A31B049UPN0OX5	The Best Coffee	I love coffee and this one of the best, if not the best, coffee I have ever tasted. It is a strong & bold dark roast coffee. Excellent flavor, no bitter, acidic aftertaste. Nice & STRONG. 100% worth the price. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.	4	0
		ADBCO3SNTV445	1 Star may be generous...	I'm not a Jerky expert or anything like some of the reviews here. But I've had a few different brands, some the national brands and some smaller ones. I'd have to say this is a bit below average. It was slightly spicy but not terribly tasty and the texture wasn't that good. I didn't get the feeling I was eating quality meat.<br /><br />So why 1 star? Easy. Within 48 hours of opening it I was greeted with bluish white mold covering about 5 or 6 pieces. I'm sure by tomorrow it will be more but it's now in the trash. I don't even know how that happens	2	1

		A20QETTR8VAVW1	A Tasty Tea, and More	"My first-time pregnant wife saw this tea and thought that it couldn't hurt, even if she doubted the efficacy of its claims. She offered me a sip of the tea, and I must say that I liked the combination of mint, fruit, lemon, and spicy flavors. I bought some more tea, and together my wife and I would each enjoy a cup in the evening while sitting out on our back porch and watching the sun set.<br /><br />About a month after drinking this delicious tea, I woke up one morning feeling very queasy. When I told my wife why I looked green in the face, she smiled at me with great compassion and love. ""You're having sympathy symptoms."" I looked at her blankly. She continued, ""It's called Couvade syndrome, from the French `couver', meaning `to hatch'. It's when men feel and experience the physical symptoms associated with pregnancy."" ""Oh,"" I said, ""I wonder how far it goes."" My wife looked at me with loving eyes, laughed, and gave me a hug. ""I love you,"" she said.<br /><br />A few weeks later I found out just how far Couvade syndrome can go when I gained twenty pounds; began suffering backaches, stomachaches, cramping, and mild incontinence; and started craving some foods while finding others nauseating. My wife found my symptoms amusing and endearing, and in that spirit I took a home-pregnancy test, for fun. When the results came back positive, I became concerned. My wife thought I was playing a joke on her, but when then next two tests also came out positive, she also became worried. On our next visit to her OB/GYN, we asked her doctor about my positive results. She looked at me with some concern and told us that elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG--the hormone tested for in at-home pregnancy tests) levels in men are sometimes indicative of testicular cancer. I think I fainted, because I next remember waking up on an exam bed. The doctor recommended an oncologist to me and I set up an appointment right away.<br /><br />The oncologist explained how hCG may be produced by germ cell tumors and had some of my blood drawn for tests. That night was the most terrifying of my life as I waited for the lab results. When I saw the doctor the next day, she gave me the happiest news of my life: besides the hCG, all the other tests were negative for the most common testicular cancers. She still wanted a biopsy to be safe, and I consented, even though the idea of extracting it was not pleasing, to say the least. The biopsy results also came back clean, but the oncologist recommended that I come back in a month to monitor any changes. In the meantime, my wife and I went back to her OB/GYN for an ultrasound, and just for fun, I asked if I could have one too. The doctor humored me and scanned my lower abdomen. When she saw the screen, however, she nearly dropped the probe. ""What is it?"" I asked. ""It looks like you have a uterus,"" she said, ""with a fetus inside of it."" I think I fainted. When I woke up, my wife and her doctor were both looking down at me with concern. ""Is he always like this?"" the doctor asked. ""Yes,"" answered my wife, ""but it's been especially bad since the pregnancy."" ""Whose?"" the doctor asked. Everybody laughed. I asked her how this could have happened, and she mentioned intersexualism and chimerism, but I assured her that I was as male as male can be. Nonetheless, she suggested genetic testing.<br /><br />I began to think very hard about when my pregnancy symptoms began, and I realized they all started with the tea. I immediately stopped drinking it, and I began to notice my symptoms slowly disappearing. I had the genetic testing done and all my cells were typically XY male, with no abnormalities. The second ultrasound showed only the appropriate abdominal organs for a male, with no trace of a uterus or fetus. In fact, the only evidence that I had ever been pregnant is a grainy photo from the first ultrasound. The medical community has dismissed my case as mass hysteria, or ""folie &agrave; deux"". They may be at a loss to explain what happened, but I know the truth."	2	19
		AZNCD3T9Z0X6V	Don't Listen to the negative reviews	So before I ordered this I was reading the reviews worrying about how some people said that when they got the coffee it was already or close to expiring.<br />Not true. I got mine today (june 16th) and mine are going to expire March 28th 2013.<br /><br />And also people said that the coffee packets came in all messed up and it looked like they just threw it in the box.<br />Not true. Mine came in a amazon box and inside is another box and the receipt. Inside the smaller box is the VIA container that is just like the picture. All little packets were still inside the starbucks packet.<br /><br />I would def ignore all those negative comments because this is a pretty good product to order! =)	0	1

"The beans are kind of small, but expend to normal size once roasted (unless they clog the roaster before they have the chance to fully expand).<br />Initially I've tried roasting them using cast iron pan.  The taste was ok, but I couldn't get the proper coffee smell.  After multiple tries I gave up and ordered a normal roaster, in hopes to eliminate the ""user error"".<br />The new roaster does make it easier and faster to roast, but everything else stayed about the same.  Not much of a smell and an ok taste.<br />May be I'll buy it again, but only after trying couple other brands to see if I can get something with the more aroma."	0	0
		A1G1M03ON24998	The only kind of Jerky I will eat.	Oberto Thin Style Peppered Beef Jerky is the only kind of Jerky I will eat. I've been eating it for 30+ years. Buying online is far cheaper than purchasing in the store. Plus it is low fat and full of protein. I love this stuff :)	2	0
		A2UHPLEZIFVNEU	Bag inconsistency	Our Great Dane puppy loved the first 30lb. bag, no problems whatsoever. The second bag, however, caused extreme projectile diarrhea(no joke), which isn't cool for anyone or thing, especially an inside dog. My wife was pretty ticked(she cleans that stuff up). Our 13 week puppy lost ten pounds and spent time in the vet hospital, just to get her digestive system back on. We will not be buying this anymore. We know for certain that it was the food. After switching to another brand, she would get better, then we'd try again. It would come back immediately. We switched to eagle pack, (red bag). It's the best!	1	6
		A1VM5U1TBANV9	It helped.	It seemed to really help at first when I bought it about a year ago. I don't know what they changed but now I see moths flying around the traps or chilling on the ceiling next to the trap for hours before I finally give up and kill the little buggers.	0	0

		A1YNN51RNUCCUA	Not bad for a non-flavored coffee	I typically like flavored coffees but had this in a sampler pack.  This was pretty good and much better than the Green Mountain Hazelnut Decaf.  It would have been better if I'd had a flavored creamer with it, but I would buy this.	0	0

		A3GQ8LQT9VX2F7	Like but not perfect	I recieved my DiposaKups and was a little disappointed.  First, they took quite awhile to arrive in the mail, however when I was tracking the product, it did say that it would take some time to deliver.  I have the Keurig Cuisinart, and the cups work ok, but they don't allow the machine to finish the brewing process.  It doesn't allow the hinge to completely close, which won't let the machine complete the brewing.  I have to take the cup out in order for it to finish.  HOWEVER, it is very convenient and makes it much more cost effective, but I don't know that I would buy them again because I'm worried I may ruin my machine.	1	0
		A16CA0LWKNZ2OL	I honestly didn't care for it.	Like another reviewer mentioned, it's thin and watery. I honestly prefer the Maxwell House stuff compared to this.

		A21PZRG2XC4RH9	Great Taste, HORRIBLE Quality Control	"I purchased these when I started the HGC diet.  They were a great choice as far as taste goes.  They satisfied my need for a crunch and they had a very pleasant taste to them.  They didn't just have that ""stale bread"" taste that a lot of breadsticks have. Also, while you do get a few burned breadsticks, you don't get to many.  For the most part they are pretty evenly cooked.<br /><br />On the down side, the quality is not that great.  Every package I opened have had broken breadsticks.  Now I know that breadsticks are fragile and I should expect a few broken ones, but for the most part, almost all of them in a package are broken, and some are broken so bad that they are just dust at the bottom.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the quality is this...so far, we've gone through 8 boxes of these breadsticks and I've come across 15 SEALED packages that contain NO breadsticks.  They are just empty wrappers, AND these empty wrappers aren't just in the box as that weird bonus wrapper you receive on occasion, they COUNT towards the number of packages of breadsticks you get in a box.<br /><br />These breadsticks are by no means cheap, and I honestly do not mind paying for something that is not only part of my diet, but something I enjoy.  I do take issue with the fact that I'm paying a premium price for a product with sub-par quality."	22	1
		ACB0CSL0QMRGQ	Misleading title and photograph	Nothing has changed since the past purchasers posted their reviews. Instead of the blue Equal packets shown in the picture, we received Sweetmate. Apparently it is the same as Equal, and if it was for my own use, I wouldn't be too upset. However, I purchased this for an office, and it's caused a bit of an uproar, as everyone thinks we have switched to an inferior sweetener - it's tough to convince the angry coffee drinkers otherwise! I realize now that the title says Sweetmate. But as it also says Equal, and shows pictures of Equal packets, I don't think it's unreasonable to be surprised when a different product arrives.	1	0
		AG2B1WL13V72Z	Unfresh product	I am very disappointed in this product.  The first box was 75% hard, not a soft powder in each envelope.  When I called to complain, I got fast results in getting a new box.  The new box was 25% hard.  I do not blame Saco, but whoever stored it incorrectly or for too long.  The fresher envelopes did make great buttermilk biscuits.	6	3
		A3PPPRY1MV2G3T	Curry Chowder	"Although after speaking with a very obnoxious customer relations person, who later informed me that she was Vice President of Quality Control, I was informed that there is no Curry in their chowder, but that's what it tasted like to me. I know there is a population of people that enjoy that taste. If this is you than you will like it. I on the other hand grew up here in NY and lived several years in Manhattan having Excellent Manhattan Clam Chowder. This chowder from Maine should find a new name for their foreign product. This very nasty customer relations/quality control VP told me that ""We can not tailor our products to everyone's pallet"" instead of just apologizing for my disappointment in their product and offering me a coupon for something else. Bad enough the soup is awful the management is worse."	0	0

		A9ZA17LXWSX5T	Product was what I expected/Was delivered quickly	Good Product.... Quick delivery.  I hate that I have to type at least 20 words for my review to count.<br /><br />This product has super powers, on eating this my 6 year old grew forearms like popeye, and beat up the school bully.  My 2 year old passed gas and the diaper exploded in the car.  It blocked my view, and I ran off the road and I was ejected from and then pinned under the car.  My wife who had also sampled this super food was able to rescue me from the car.<br /><br />The moral is eat this food, so you can save yourself from all your daily mishaps, and perhaps when we see the person responsible for making the comments require at least 20 words when 4 would have done, you can pull their underwear up over their head, and punch them silly.	4	0
		A1SS8JO3QJPDOJ	Awesomely delicious!	This tea is wonderfully light, smells so intriguing, nice and fresh and piney.  The leaves are absolutely perfect, not broken or squished!  Beautiful product inside and out.  Would highly recommend to every tea drinker who seriously loves certain types of tea.  This silver needle was superb, I even skipped using a dash of honey it was that good.  The price I felt was fair too. It comes with two tins which is perfect for gift giving, sharing, or just plain enjoying a few well brewed pots a day!	0	1

		A5K3CK2PWYQ7O	Good, robust coffee	One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.	0	0
		A2TWDT92R8VPTI	Tastes just like bacon!	I had a bag of these during a trip to London. I was looking for Walker's Frazzles but this was the only bacon-flavored chips I could find at the Tesco.

		AMYXUUGA0E9Y1	Recommended only for special occasions	"You've heard the saying: If it's too good to be true, it probably is...<br /><br />Well, I received my Whey Low products and made some mini vanilla cupcakes (a low-fat recipe using shredded zucchini) topped chocolate butter cream icing.  I used the Whey Low D (for diabetics) in the cupcakes and Whey Low powder for the icing.  Both products certainly performed better than Splenda (and even the Splenda for Baking sugar/splenda blend).  It looks and tastes like sugar in the cupcake recipe.  It baked up beautifully and browned nicely.  I was very pleased with the Whey Low D's performance in the cupcake.<br /><br />The Whey Low Powder at first looked like it was going to make great butter cream icing, but after spreading it on the cupcakes, it began to loosen up and turned into a thick glaze after a short while.  The taste is sweet, but the icing was grainy in texture.  Within a few hours, the icing had begun to run a bit down the sides of the cupcakes and by morning it was a wet puddle at the bottom of each cupcake.  So, it did not perform like ordinary powdered sugar in this recipe.  I think it would work fine for making a glaze or for dusting the top of a cake, but not for a real cake frosting.  Also, I would suggest eating it within a few hours of application, otherwise it will break down and be a mess.  The results were quite disappointing and only slightly better than Splenda in this type of recipe.<br /><br />The unfortunate news is that the mini cupcakes did raise my blood sugar to some degree, so you can't expect your blood sugar to not be affected.  I ate three mini cupcakes for my test, then I checked my blood every 30 minutes for about 1 hours and it went steadily up from 150 to 202.  Whey Low declares that it's 70% lower in calories than regular sugar, which may still make it a good choice for cakes and cookies over using regular sugar if you want to make a special dessert, such as a birthday cake once a year.  But I don't plan to replace Splenda in most of my cooking because of my blood sugar results.  NOTE: Ordinarily, I wouldn't have eaten three mini cupcakes in one sitting, but I did this time because I wanted to see how my blood sugar would react to a larger dose of the Whey Low in what might be a normal serving of cake (and one mini cupcake wouldn't have been large enough).<br /><br />Whey Low is not the miracle I hoped it would be, but I'm glad to know of an alternative to Splenda for baking cakes and other baked pastry sweets.  I very rarely make them, but on my birthday or at Christmas I do like to have a piece of cake and have it taste ""normal.""  I will reserve Whey Low for these rare, special occasions.<br /><br />Sorry folks!  I guess we still can't have our cake, eat it and not feel the effect on our hips and in our blood sugar readings.  Darn....."	26	0
		ALPISIY10VCSY	Whoa! That's quite a price increase!!!	These are delicious cookies but I just cancelled my subscription. I hope the price comes back down so I can buy them again. They are the best ginger snaps I have found so far but the price is just too much :-(	1	0
		A1SUC50YNG730H	Trouble opening the cans	I don't know if anyone else has trouble with the pull-tabs on these Canidae cans but I sure do.  The tab part is very flimsy and doesn't hold up well while trying to pull open the top.  I have almost cut myself several times.  End up having to pry the top off with a fork after the pull-top breaks off.  Otherwise it's an acceptable product, although I do prefer Evangers.  But Evangers has become more expensive for some reason.	1	1

		A32WSR5H1JHPJH	Ew	I bought this as a filler item for my order to bring the total up so that it would qualify for free shipping. As a regular at the gym I have a curiosity about any food that promises lots of protein. This wasn't for me - or my wife - but, hey, it's food, and that's very subjective. Someone else (or his goat) might love this stuff. It smells like rope (it is a hemp product, after all) and doesn't dissolve well in milk, leaving a nasty, gritty mud at the bottom of the glass that sticks to the teeth.	4	2

		A1V0D3XFFNVPU2	Aboslutely wonderful for my pitbull	I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).	3	0

		A3B8F6PMZOCZTG	this product is not for sensitive people: it made me very very sick	I bought one of these to try after reading something online about how it works great and has no crash.  Cautiously, I drank a small sip from a bottle.  Probably less than a 16th of the two serving bottle.  Very soon I was tweaking quite extremely and my friend noticed how irritable I had become from the drink.  However, it did seem to wear off a few hours later without a crash.  I gave it a tentative try the next day, only drinking a tiny sip twice during the day.  Similar effect, so far so good.  The third day I tried a tiny sip in the morning and developed an excruciating headache and nausea that has lasted for two days now.  I feel extremely overwired and unable to come down from it.  Very very sick.  I feel horrible still two days later and I hope I improve soon.	1	5

		A1NH6UGER6N9EL	Random luck fly trap	I don't really think that the design of the cardboard box makes one bit of difference to the flies. House or fruit flies. Flies land on pretty much anything. With sufficient time flies flying around randomly and landing randomly around the house. Eventually they'll land on the fly trap.<br /><br />Perhaps after the first few have landed and died on the trap the rest will be attracted to the scent of the dead flies? Directly out of the box, I don't think there is anything on it that is an attractant.	1	1
		AD7IBJCYSJ9EE	Since I can't think of anything else to write about...	I guess I'll review this. Bought one at the gas station, and personally, i love it. The inside has a cheesy-like texture, and it tastes quite spicy. Like all red meat, though, it's not good for you, so eat sparingly. I know meat eating is slowly declining, but here where I live, veganism is not seen. So ignore PETA's cries and take a bite out of this.	0	0
		A1CF1EH4GG3R7P	Deliciously different little wafer cookies	I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)	8	0
		AUUFW7PTUHLT	Not enough truffle for the salt	I was disappointed in this product. I had enjoyed truffle salt from another manufacturer, which had so much truffle that whenever I opened the lid, the delightful aroma filled the room. But it is no longer available, so I was hoping to find a similar product on Amazon. This ain't it; the truffle is barely detectible when sniffing the open bottle and not detectible on food at all. I'm debating whether to just throw it out so I can re-use the bottle to try a different brand. (The bottle is reusable, which is why I rated it more than one star.)	0	2

The only suggestion I would make is not to use all the rice noodles that come with the meal.  There is really not enough sauce to completely cover the noodles and the sauce is really good.  I use only about 2/3 of the rice noodles and it is still plenty of food for two people.	1	0

(Sugar)  The slight spelling difference is to decieve those that read ingredient labels to think they are reading Sucrose and not notice it is Sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose causes severe abdominal pain, so if you have had that after chewing gum, now you know why.<br /><br />Aspartame has dozens of books and thousands of websites explaining what is wrong with that, as well as the other one.<br /><br />Very sad that I never again will get to enjoy my childhood favorites of Wrigley's Spearmint, Juicy Fruit or Big Red ever again.	0	2

		A2ZUPPUAG99J1O	Good food for sensitive dog	I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.	0	0

		A28Y1M7GRG0I9M	Quality is not good	"I was disappointed to see all the little, broken tea ""branches"" inside. It seems like it's the scrap or leftovers of all the good leaves being picked out. I guess you get what you pay for. I will not buy this again. You will need to use a lot of it to make a good aromatic, strong tea. The tea does taste good but you need to use a lot. If you use a little bit, then there's no taste. I also bought the Numi Organic Jasmine Green Tea Pearl which cost more, but worth it. I would recommend you buy that.  Those tea leaves (pearls) are quality and just a few of them make a tasty, strong tea."	0	0

		A29WTWII13FR24	Dirty Is Definitely A Good Way To Describe It	I found this product to be horrible.  The juice was extremely cloudy and there was also a thick white colored residue at the bottom of the bottle.  It cleared somewhat when shaken in the bottle however it never went away.  I felt the juice tasted somewhat bitter and I didn't care for the taste it added in my martini.  I stored several bottles sideways on a shelf in my liquor cabinet and noticed within about two months they were leaking from around the cap with a rusty slimy residue dripping out.	3	3
		A19XBW5WUDH1Z	Very Unimpressed	I really wanted to like Velvetta's Cheesy Skillets Chicken and Broccoli but I don't.<br />When the product arrived I looked at the box cover and it looked delicious.<br />I looked at the ingredient label and I began to worry. The ingredients list is<br />long. The product just seems so processed. I thought maybe I could save it by adding real ingredients like<br />fresh broccoli but decided this first round I had to try it just as directed.<br />I was disappointed in the quality of the dehydrated broccoli. I really felt like this was something you feed someone<br />that you aren't very fond of. I've never been to prison but I imagined that this might be the stuff they are given.<br />Perhaps death row inmates are served this for their last meal so they actually want to go willingly to the execution room so they don't have to eat any more.<br />After I cooked it, it just looked wrong. It smelled wrong. I know I could cook better. I don't think this saves that much time.<br />I'm trying to move away from processed foods. If you are also perhaps you want to avoid this.	0	1
		A1Z2XFNF0TJV07	My Grandkids will not eat this	I have 3 Grandkids (3 different families) all 2 years old and I can not get any of them to eat this stuff they all hate it. I'm not sure what brands their parents by them from the local grocery store but I will have to see if I can give these to someone else because they will not eat it ugh. What a waste of money	0	4
		A3EE6H7631H0V4	Quick, Easy and Tasty	The local auto shop offers this free to it customers. I've tried it twice and liked it both times. Perhaps, if I had to pay for it, I might not love the price, but I would still enjoy the flavor.	0	0
		A3LXSTJ8WT0WO8	Used to be great...until they changed the recipe	We'd been getting Greens Puffs for a while now for our 12 month old, and he used to love them - in fact, he couldn't get enough of them. However, based on our most recent shipment, the puffs are now smaller and mostly have a much thicker green powder coating than they used to. I gave my son the new puffs, hoping he'd like them just as much, but alas, now he really doesn't like them. He'll take a bite of a few, and then he just starts throwing them on the ground. I tasted one to see what the difference was, and honestly, I don't blame him for not liking them.  They have a sort of citrus flavor, and do have a really odd smell, almost like seaweed or seaweed flavored foods. I used to have a subscription for these, but I've cancelled it and now I have a box of six containers of these puffs that I don't know what to do with. Happy Baby shouldn't have messed with a successful formula. I used to like that he was getting something a little different, but we're just going to stick with Cheerios from now on.	0	0
		AG7EF0SVBQOUX	My favorite flavor	I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.	2	0

		A31MZR41SM9JU5	Too SOUR!	I love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it.	1	6
		A1KMAL01GC3RN4	Maybe Worth $20	The games reminded me of something that you would get in a grab bag at the dollar store with some candy scattered in. The Texas Hold Em poker set was missing, but I didn't mind since the gift was intended for two kids.  This would be a nice gift for maybe as much as $20, but I don't know how they can charge $50+ for what is actually included.	6	0
		A3QRW0UJPKIAX7	Nice Coffee, Not so nice package	I tried this coffee with a bit of trepidation. I'm not a fan of hazelnut. I've always found the flavor to be a bit overwhelming which is odd because I really like hazelnuts. Not so here. This was a very tasty hazelnut. The smell was subtle and not at all over-powering. The flavor was nice, nutty without getting into oily & nasty. The coffee in the package is a nice dark color. It's very finely ground so should work well in capacino machines. It brewed up very nicely in our french press and our drip coffee machine. I really enjoyed the experience.<br /><br />The bag on the other hand, I struggled for quite a while to get it open and finally just had to cut the top off. Which made it more than bit difficult to use for later storage. I understand that to retain the freshness, sealing the bag is very important, but in order for me to consume the product, opening the bag is equally important. And since I may be under the assumption that I can continue to store the coffe in the bag, like other brands, making it so I have to partially destroy the bag in order to open it seems slightly counter-intuitive.<br /><br />Anyway, great coffee, not so great packaging. If you get it, make plans for alternate storage.	0	0
		A1FP5ZLSKR07SU	Weak	I like a hearty cup of coffee, not bitter. This is quite weak on the Keurig medium setting, which I most frequently use, and just tolerable on the small cup setting.<br /><br />I prefer Donut Shop, Fog Chaser, and other rich-bodied coffees -- and I even like Lake & Lodge, whioh isn't a rich coffee if that helps you compare.<br /><br />This is so-so even when I mix it with a good flavored coffee; it just lacks its own flavor.	0	1
		A3AJDID6Q2M7HZ	Bad Tasting	When I first opened the bottle it smelled medicinal. I added it to some iced tea and it tasted just like it smelled, very medicinal and only a trace of fruit flaver. I ordered 2 other flavors and they're the same. I gave it an extra star because service is good, but I can't recommend the extract.	7	0
		A4DRUXUYLCHIP	Pathetic	These had to be the WORST Rawhides ever!! They were all different sizes and NOT shaped like in the picture. More like a CLUMP!! Very Very disappointed with this purchase.

No WONDER AMAZON sold them for less...Shame on you AMAZON!! This is something clearly noticeable.....Not happy, not happy at all with AMAZON :-(	0	2

		AQ1010TWA6KVX	Good Customer Service	I bought this bouillon because it was gluten free but because I wasn't able to read the ingredient list I didn't find out that it had dairy in it. Additionally it is not possible to return the product even though it was never opened so it was a complete waste of money. Many people that have a problem with gluten also have a problem with dairy so I don't think it makes much sense to make a gluten free product that has dairy in it. Other common allergens that are in the product are corn and soy.<br /><br />After contacting the manufacturer I found out that the sodium free version of this seasoning is gluten (wheat) and casein (dairy) free so if you have these allergies buy the sodium free version.	0	1
		A89ZZKNDFQH23	It looks like stew	It really looked like a bowl of stew.  My dogs seemed to scarf it down, which was a relief.  My wowser, jack, only ever seems to eat blue without me having to dress his food up with grated meat or cheese.  Pepper will eat anything so it didn't surprise me that she enjoyed this just as much as blue or nature's choice.	0	0
		A3OJX18B60PJR9	Props for improvements but still a lower quality food source for Dogs	"Beneful has worked hard to improve their overall ingredient blend since it's debut as a brand but this is still a ""Cheap"" grocery store brand of Dog Food that is Corn-based and whose parent company, Purina/Nestle, has been known to source some pet food ingredients from problematic sources such as China where there is virtually NO oversight.  That said, Dogs do find this food palatable and MY DOG liked it very much but I only allowed him to have a few meals of it by itself.  I tried mixing it into his higher quality meat-based Kibble but then he started to notice the difference and would cleverly pick out only his ""Good"" food kibbles to eat, leabving the Beneful behind.  Smart dog.  Would you like to see a list of the ingredients by weight straight from Beneful's own site?  Here ya go:<br /><br />Ingredients by weight:<br />Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, water, meat and bone meal, propylene glycol, sugar, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, animal digest, potassium chloride, sorbic acid (a preservative), dried peas, dried carrots, calcium propionate (a preservative), choline chloride, l-Lysine monohydrochloride, Vitamin E supplement, zinc sulfate, red 40, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, yellow 6, yellow 5, Vitamin A supplement, blue 2, calcium carbonate, copper sulfate, Vitamin B-12 supplement, brewers dried yeast, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br /><br />Now, looking at this list, I do notice some improvements and so I want to at least acknowledge that they are TRYING to make a better ""budget"" dog food.  The only problem with that is that Corn allergies and Corn-based diets are not natural for dogs and have been linked to any number of diseases but most comellingly to Canine Epilepsy, something I have personal experience with.  I can tell you honestly that it is far better to ante up for a Meat protein kibble all of your dogs life than to ""save"" money by feeding him or her Corn based kibble until they develop Canine Epilepsy.  If they do, you are in for a world of hurt in your pocketbook and wtaching your best buddy suffer through seizures and the side effects of the seizure meds it's just not worth that $5  to $8 less a bag.  Also, as I mentioned in another review, there's the idea of ""False Economy"" involved.  If you buy a higher quality kibble, you need to feed less of it to Doggie who digests it more completely and benefits from it with better health and fewer dental issues.<br /><br />I don't want to send Beneful the wrong message by giving them 1 star because they HAVE improved their overall mix of ingreidents a great deal since they first came out.  I would suggest that they may still be able to  make further improvements without raising the price a great deal more.  If they were willing to charge a dollar or two more per bag, they could use more quality protein sources and less grain based fillers.  I know some people will buy this no matter what.  I have a friend who showed me a comparison of the protein perecentages that showed beneful was ""comperable"" to a brand I once used.  However, it is the QUALITY and SOURCE of the protein that matters.  Corn Gluten provides protein as do ground up waste parts from chicken factory farming but is that good for Doggie over the course of his life?  No.  Not really.<br /><br />For those wondering what I did with the rest of the bag, I donated it to a shelter that mixed it in with higher quality canned food and they were glad to have it.  I'll still keep hoping that Purina/Nestle gets it right and I will try them again in the future  but right now, I'm awake to the False Economy of paying less now only to pay high Vet Bills in the end."	1	1

		A1USXVZKR61OPP	poor service from this company	"When I purchased this sauce to aid in my Atkins diet, it was shown CLEARLY to be a 6 pack.  The title said it, the photo had one of those little text bubbles on it that said ""6 pack"" and the shipping weight was listed at like 5 pounds or something.  TITLE AS LISTED: ""Walden Farms Sauce Barbecue Thick Calorie Free, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)""<br /><br />One (1) bottle arrived, so I called the shipper who said the listing was wrong, and not their fault.  They said Amazon writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them.<br />I called Amazon, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller.<br />After several more ""going nowhere"" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Amazon, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded.<br /><br />Amazon ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping.<br /><br />I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again.  I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well. Bad, poor, lousy, unpleasant, untruthful customer service.<br /><br />By the way, the sauce is good, and I have since found it available in my local CUB Foods grocery store in their diabetic section."	9	3
		A2NSC9A2TZT92W	Okay, but NOT instant oatmeal.	For some reason, the instructions say to only cook this in the microwave.  I don't know why since it's not quick oats, but more like the old fashioned oatmeal that you have to cook on the stove.  It takes about 5 minutes to cook in the microwave and you have to make sure to use a good size bowl or it will boil over and make a huge mess.  As for the taste, only one of my kids likes it.  For the rest of us, it's just a very strange flavor for oatmeal.	0	0

		A1VMGZBVUPUY2R	This gelatin smells very bad when hot.	"I used this gelatin to make marshmallows. When it was hot it smelled VERY bad. I called the company and they said, ""the beef gelatin has always smelled more than the pork."" The marshmallows came out very good, but the smell was so bad I remember it and it turned my stomach. It does not smell in the package at room temperature.<br /><br />Addition: After wondering why boiled cartilage would smell so bad, I looked at the FDA website. The production of gelatin seems to be completely un-inspected. The FDA has no jurisdiction over post food production items like this. The FDA says that this industry uses dropped cows and other items designated as not suitable for food.<br /><br />From the FDA:<br /><br />""Domestically, generally human food that<br />contains meat only in a relatively small proportion or that<br />historically has not been considered by consumers to be products of the<br />meat food industry (e.g., soup stock, beef flavors and extracts,<br />gelatin), is not produced under USDA inspection (see definition of<br />``meat food product'' in 21 U.S.C. 601(j)) and may be physically<br />available for use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics. Further,<br />even when excluded from human food produced in USDA-inspected<br />establishments, prohibited cattle materials may leave the<br />establishments for inedible rendering or destruction. These materials,<br />which previously have not been explicitly prohibited in human food and<br />cosmetics by FDA, might then be used in FDA-regulated human food or<br />cosmetics. For example, prohibited cattle materials leaving a USDA-<br />inspected facility might not be denatured sufficiently to preclude<br />their use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics.<br />  Under the Food Safety and Inspection Services' (FSIS') rule, SRMs,<br />small intestine from all cattle, and material from nonambulatory<br />disabled cattle must be designated as inedible. However, certain<br />products, such as gelatin and collagen (which are both covered by the<br />provisions of this rule) used in FDA-regulated human food and<br />cosmetics, have traditionally been produced from cattle material deemed<br />inedible by the USDA. Therefore, such a designation by the USDA may not<br />be enough to preclude use of prohibited cattle materials in FDA-<br />regulated products without additional regulation by FDA. Further, some<br />cattle are not slaughtered under continuous USDA inspection (e.g., some<br />are sent directly to rendering). Cattle material from these animals,<br />such as brains or bones which include SRMs, could end up as starting<br />material for human food, such as meat extracts or gelatin,<br />respectively. Furthermore, if prohibited cattle materials were used in<br />FDA-regulated human food or cosmetics, the rule would facilitate FDA's<br />ability to use the enforcement mechanisms of the Federal Food, Drug,<br />and Cosmetic Act (the act) that apply to adulterated products (e.g.,<br />seizure) to prevent human exposure to the prohibited cattle materials.""<br />Federal Register - 69FR 42255 July 14, 2004: Interim Final Rule -- Use of Materials Derived From Cattle in Human Food and Cosmetics<br /><br />[...]"	6	14
		A2JT9TJ74UYK30	Meaty texture	Very meaty texture for a vegetarian product.  Looks like fresh ground beef after you mix it with water.  I would recommend this product.  I also want to try the sausage variety.	2	0
		A2F540P3L6P5CL	A bit underwhelmed	There really wasn't a lot of heat in this one for me, although I do like things hotter than most folks. I don't have Mexican food (or chips) in the house or eat it on regular occasions so I haven't been able to sample try this product out on them. I did try it as a condiment to my ever-so-boring turkey and it was OK, but I prefer the spicy mustards instead. I did try some today in a salad and that was OK, but not one I'd recommend or use again. The product has an oily texture/taste to it, and if I was going to go for something so fatty I think I'd prefer it to be a sour cream base instead of oil base.<br /><br />If you aren't worried about fat and calories and eat a lot of Mexican food products this might suit, but otherwise I'd give it a pass. There's not enough flavor to make it worth the added calories for me.	0	0
